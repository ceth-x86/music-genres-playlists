# Glitch / Microsound

## Proto-Glitch Foundations (1994–1999)

**Oval — Aero Deck (Systemisch, 1994)**
Early, definitive "damaged-digital" composition where discontinuity becomes structure. It anticipates the clicks-and-cuts vocabulary by making artifact the main musical voice.

**Yasunao Tone — Minim: Part I (Solo for Wounded CD, 1997)**
A landmark statement of intentional media-failure as sound source—glitch not as decoration, but as method. Its microscopic ruptures foreshadow the later microsound obsession with event-level detail.

**Pita — ce3 (Get Out, 1999)**
A reductionist, post-industrial microsound approach: sparse events, brittle digital grit, and slow structural pressure. It shows glitch as a compositional logic rather than a "special effect."

## Clicks & Cuts: Codifying the Aesthetic (2000)

**Frank Bretschneider — Kern (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
A crisp lattice of micro-percussion and clipped pulses that helped define "precision minimalism" inside glitch. It's a textbook case of rhythm built from tiny transients rather than drums.

**SND — Circa 1509 (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
Minimal sine events and microscopic timing shifts create forward motion without overt "beats." It's foundational microsound: restraint, placement, and micro-variation as form.

**Farben — Raute (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
Glitch as groove-engine: loops feel catchy because of cut patterns, not melody. A key example of how microsound can read as "songful" while staying artifact-first.

**Vladislav Delay — Synkopoint (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
Syncopation is implied through stutters and voids, turning absence into rhythm. It's an early statement of "deconstructed groove" built from glitches and space.

**Pole — Spaß (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
Crackle and digital residue function as percussion, reframing dub-space through microsound technique. The track's identity is the artifact: a rhythmic ecology of pops and decay.

Raw electrical pulses and hard-edged minimal events show glitch as signal, not ambiance. Its severity clarifies the genre's link to reductionism and electronic materiality.

**Alva Noto — Prototype N. (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
An iconic "data-aesthetic" grammar: clicks as geometry, tones as gridlines. It's a blueprint for microsound's clean, scientific sense of musical space.

**Skist — Shift (Clicks & Cuts, 2000)**
Abrupt edits and minimal phrasing make the cut itself the central gesture. A strong example of how form can emerge from discontinuity alone.
