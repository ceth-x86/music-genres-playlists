# Psychodelic Rock

## Proto-Psychedelic Breakthroughs (1965–1966)

**The Yardbirds — Shapes of Things (Roger the Engineer, 1966)**
A cornerstone of proto-psych: fuzz tone, droning harmony, and a sense of "expanding" guitar space. It's one of the clearest early moments where rock's vocabulary tilts toward hallucination-by-timbre rather than blues-based realism.

**The Beatles — Tomorrow Never Knows (Revolver, 1966)**
Psychedelia as studio architecture: drone logic, tape manipulation, and an anti-linear song feel. It became a blueprint for treating recorded sound as a perceptual environment, not just documentation.

**The Byrds — Eight Miles High (Fifth Dimension, 1966)**
A definitive early raga-rock crossover: modal melody and cyclic guitar figures conjure "vertical time." It's historically pivotal for normalizing the idea that rock could sound transportive without losing drive.

**The Beach Boys — Good Vibrations (Non-album single, 1966)**
Psychedelic effects via composition and production: modular structure, uncanny textures, and a dreamlike emotional arc. It proved psych sonics could be radically experimental and massively accessible.

**The Rolling Stones — Paint It, Black (Aftermath, 1966)**
A dark, droning psych-single that makes timbre and modality the hook. It's a key example of psychedelia infiltrating mainstream rock without becoming "just" classic rock attitude.

**Donovan — Sunshine Superman (Sunshine Superman, 1966)**
One of the earliest major hits built around psychedelic imagery and a languid, hypnotic groove. It helped establish the genre's pop-facing side while keeping the atmosphere unmistakably trippy.

**Love — She Comes in Colors (Da Capo, 1966)**
Kaleidoscopic LA psych: shifting dynamics, bright textures, and a painterly sense of sonic color. It's a concise template for how psychedelia can be arranged as much as it is improvised.

**The 13th Floor Elevators — You're Gonna Miss Me (The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators, 1966)**
Acid-rock urgency with a uniquely manic psychedelic charge—fast, raw, and unhinged in the right way. It crystallizes the "mind-expanding" aesthetic as intensity and repetition, not just studio trickery.

**The Blues Magoos — (We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet (Psychedelic Lollipop, 1966)**
Organ-and-fuzz propelled psychedelia that helped define American radio-friendly psych. The track's punchy distortion and swirling momentum make the "trip" feel physical and immediate.

**Count Five — Psychotic Reaction (Psychotic Reaction, 1966)**
A garage-rooted hit with unmistakable psychedelic rupture: the breakdown feels like a reality-slip. Historically, it's crucial for showing how psychedelia could be injected into raw rock without polishing the edges.

**The Electric Prunes — I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night) (The Electric Prunes, 1966)**
One of the era's cleanest examples of "dream logic" in rock: phased textures, hazy hooks, and disorientation as form. It's psych as aural fog, not virtuoso display.

**The Misunderstood — I Can Take You to the Sun (Non-album single, 1966)**
A cult psych single where feedback and harmonic tension feel like narrative forces. It's frequently cited as a peak 1966 psychedelia artifact precisely because it sounds ahead of its moment.

## The 1967 Psychedelic Explosion

**Jefferson Airplane — White Rabbit (Surrealistic Pillow, 1967)**
A canonical "psychedelic narrative" with bolero propulsion and surreal imagery. It distills the genre's ability to turn repetition into ritual and escalation into revelation.

Studio psychedelia with philosophical swagger: reversed guitar, spatial motion, and meta-lyrics about perception. It's a defining statement that psychedelic rock can be both visceral and conceptually disorienting.

**Pink Floyd — Interstellar Overdrive (The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, 1967)**
A foundational psychedelic jam: riff → dissolution → reformation, mirroring the "trip arc." It's essential for the British side of psychedelia where improvisation becomes the form itself.

**The Doors — The End (The Doors, 1967)**
Psychedelia as theatre: modal hypnosis, extended structure, and an atmosphere that feels ritualistic rather than songlike. It demonstrates the genre's darker, immersive potential without shifting into art-rock abstraction.

**Small Faces — Itchycoo Park (Non-album single, 1967)**
The sound of phasing/flanging becoming pop grammar: bright, pastoral, and chemically swirled. A key British psych single where studio effect is the emotional message.

Raga-tinted chords and buoyant whimsy, but with a genuinely psychedelic harmonic glow. It captures 1967 UK psychedelia's blend of craft and playful unreality.

Fuzz and spiraling riffing translate anxiety into psychedelic motion. It's a crucial bridge showing how a band with folk-rock roots could produce a fully psychedelic attack.

**The Who — I Can See for Miles (The Who Sell Out, 1967)**
Studio maximalism as hallucination—layered sound, intensity, and a sense of sonic overload. It's psych-rock as production spectacle, not just lyrical weirdness.

**The Smoke — My Friend Jack (Non-album single, 1967)**
A classic British psychedelic single: clever storytelling wrapped in lysergic arrangement choices. It captures the era's mix of pop craft and perceptual wink.
