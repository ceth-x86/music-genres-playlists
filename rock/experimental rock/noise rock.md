# Noise Rock

## Proto-Noise Rock & First Wave (1970–1989)

**The Stooges — L.A. Blues (Fun House, 1970)**
A proto-noise-rock meltdown: free-form squall, sax abuse, and rhythmic collapse. It's an early proof that distortion and texture can be the song's main event.

**Flipper — Sex Bomb (Album – Generic Flipper, 1982)**
Slow-motion punk as corrosive noise: bass weight and deliberate ugliness replace speed. This template fed later sludge-leaning noise rock and grunge-era heaviness.

**The Birthday Party — She's Hit (Junkyard, 1982)**
Blues tradition pushed into abrasion: shards of guitar, apocalyptic vocal theatre, and industrial thud. A key bridge from post-punk menace into noise rock's physicality.

**Swans — Stay Here (Filth, 1983)**
Relentless repetition and blunt-force sonics make the groove feel punitive rather than celebratory. A defining early statement of noise rock as endurance, density, and control.

**No Trend — Too Many Humans (Too Many Humans....., 1983)**
Hardcore rhythms weaponized into sneering dissonance and anti-scene satire. It's foundational to the 'break it from within' attitude that noise rock inherits from punk.

**The U-Men — Gila (U-Men (EP), 1984)**
A swampy, distorted stomp that warps garage rock into something meaner and stranger. It captures an early Pacific Northwest thread where noise is the hook.

**Butthole Surfers — The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's Grave (Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac, 1984)**
Psychedelia and punk collide in tape-warped chaos, with sound effects and rupture as structure. It exemplifies the genre's taste for destabilizing 'rock' from the inside.

**Live Skull — Bringing Home the Bait (Bringing Home the Bait, 1985)**
NYC's post-no wave edge: jagged riffs, nervous pacing, and abrasive room-sound. A scene-defining cut that helped codify 'noise rock' as a band format, not just an effect.

**Sonic Youth — Death Valley '69 (Bad Moon Rising, 1985)**
Detuned guitars and clangorous resonance turn a 'song' into a feedback architecture. It's a canonical early blueprint for noise rock guitar language and atmosphere.

**Grong Grong — Angels And Demons (Grong Grong, 1986)**
Australian noise rock at its most feral: pounding drums and blown-out guitars with ritual intensity. It's part of the Antipodean lineage often overlooked in US-centric histories.

**Scratch Acid — Cannibal (Just Keep Eating, 1986)**
A masterclass in tension: stop-start riffs, psychotic vocal phrasing, and dry-room impact. It's a direct ancestor to the Chicago/Texas strain of 90s noise rock.

**Big Black — Kerosene (Atomizer, 1986)**
Drum-machine propulsion and serrated guitar make the riff feel mechanized and cruel. Few tracks define noise rock's precision-and-violence aesthetic more clearly.

**Feedtime — Shovel (Shovel, 1986)**
Primitive, ugly groove with distortion as texture rather than 'tone.' A hugely influential Australian take on scuzz and repetition that prefigures many 90s underground bands.

**White Zombie — Ratmouth (Soul-Crusher, 1987)**
Early White Zombie's art-damaged grind is closer to downtown noise than later metal swagger. A snapshot of late-80s US underground where distortion and collage ruled.

Hard-edged dynamics and abrasive guitar interplay without conceding to metal or indie neatness. A key link between post-hardcore tension and noise rock texture.

**Rapeman — Trouser Minnow (Two Nuns and a Pack Mule, 1988)**

**Boredoms — Soul Discharge (Soul Discharge, 1989)**
Noise rock turned into hyperactive frenzy: tempos mutate, textures explode, and chaos becomes composition. A landmark of Japan's radical contribution to the genre.

**Steel Pole Bath Tub — Time to Die (Butterfly Love, 1989)**
Claustrophobic, hooky abrasion that balances repetition with grotesque detail. It's a bridge from late-80s US noise into the tighter, more song-like 90s era.

## Underground Peak & Label Era (1990–1996)

A pop hook forced through abrasive guitars and sharp-edged production. It demonstrates how noise rock can weaponize melody without becoming alternative rock polish.

European noise rock with a hard, grinding edge and no interest in prettiness. It's a reminder that the genre's blunt physicality wasn't limited to US scenes.
