## Pioneering Era (1991–1999)

**Skyclad — The Widdershins Jig (The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth, 1991)**
A formative folk‑metal template: thrash‑leaning riffs and sharp vocals framed by unmistakably British folk fiddling and jig rhythms. It helped establish the idea that traditional dance forms could drive metal songwriting rather than just decorate it.

**Primordial — To Enter Pagan (Dark Romanticism (Demo), 1993)**
An early keystone for pagan metal, pairing blackened intensity with overt pre‑Christian identity and atmosphere. The song is frequently cited as part of the genre's early definition and scene vocabulary.

**Orphaned Land — The Beloved's Cry (Sahara, 1994)**

**Cruachan — To Invoke the Horned God (Tuatha na Gael, 1995)**
