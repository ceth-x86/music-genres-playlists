# Space Rock

## A. Prehistory & Pioneers (1962–1973)

**The Spotnicks — The Rocket Man (The Spotnicks in London, Out-a Space, 1962)**
Although coming from instrumental rock rather than prog, this single helped codify the 'space-age' stagecraft and futuristic guitar tone that space rock later amplified. Its twangy electronics and astronaut imagery are a true prehistory of the style.

**Pink Floyd — Interstellar Overdrive (The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, 1967)**
A foundational 'cosmic' freak-out where extended improvisation, tape-like guitar effects, and spacey organ textures became a template for space rock's trance forms. Its emphasis on atmosphere over songcraft is the genre's origin story in miniature.

**Lothar and the Hand People — Space Hymn (Space Hymn, 1969)**
One of the most explicit late-60s attempts to marry rock songs with electronics in a space-age frame. The wired-in textures and sci-fi psychedelia foreshadow space rock's later fixation on timbre and 'otherworldly' sonics.

**Black Sabbath — Planet Caravan (Paranoid, 1970)**
A rare early heavy-rock track that prioritizes weightless ambience—phased guitars, soft percussion, and an almost 'vacuum' mix. Its slow drift anticipates the mellow, narcotic side of space rock later explored by neo-psych acts.

**Hawkwind — Hurry On Sundown (Hawkwind, 1970)**
Early Hawkwind already fuses bluesy riffing with sci-fi ambience and electronics, pointing toward the band's later full-blown space rock language. The track's drifting groove and effects-led soundstage are classic 'UK cosmic' signifiers.

**UFO — Flying (UFO 1, 1970)**
From UFO's early, space-themed phase, this is a slow-burner built on echo, sustained guitars, and a weightless pulse rather than hard-rock attack. It's a key example of how space rock grew alongside early prog and heavy psych.

**Nektar — Journey to the Centre of the Eye (Journey to the Centre of the Eye, 1971)**
A prog concept-suite that uses recurring motifs and expansive arrangements to evoke deep-space travel and altered perception. Its long-form flow and synth-tinted guitar work helped define the 'cosmic prog' wing of space rock.

**Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come — Internal Messenger (Galactic Zoo Dossier, 1971)**
A synth-streaked, theatrical prog-psych piece that treats electronics as part of the 'astronautics' narrative, not decoration. It shows how space rock's futurism often arrived via timbre—VCS3 squalls, oscillators, and destabilized grooves.

**Captain Beyond — Dancing Madly Backwards (On a Sea of Air) (Captain Beyond, 1972)**
Hard-edged space rock can be riff-driven without losing its cosmic scale, and this track is an early proof. The spiraling structure and sci-fi atmosphere bridge heavy psych and the later Hawkwind-school 'space-boogie.'

**Gong — Flying Teapot (Radio Gnome Invisible Part I: Flying Teapot, 1973)**
Gong's early 'Radio Gnome' mythology helped turn psychedelic drift into a fully realized cosmic world-build—a key space rock impulse. This title track mixes extended grooves, synth color, and sci-fi narrative in a way later spacerock acts inherited wholesale.

## B. First-Wave Canon (1974–1982)

**Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix — Starcruiser (New Worlds Fair, 1975)**
A cult Hawkwind-adjacent artifact where sci-fi worldbuilding meets rock drive—space rock as countercultural storytelling. 'Starcruiser' is concise but drenched in the genre's signatures: cosmic narrative, overdriven guitars, and a sense of forward motion.

**Klaatu — Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft (3:47 EST, 1976)**
A rare 'space rock' hit in pop form: the radio-friendly side of cosmic futurism. The long album version's sustained build and celestial harmonies show how the genre's sense of scale can exist without heaviness.

**Starcastle — Lady of the Lake (Starcastle, 1976)**
American prog rarely sounds this 'astral': big, sustaining chords and synth-guitar interplay that evokes open space rather than blues grit. Its long, unfolding form anticipates later U.S. spacerock's taste for widescreen arrangements.

**Omega — Time Robber (Time Robber, 1976)**
A quintessential Eastern-bloc 'cosmic prog' track—grand themes, synth sheen, and a journeying structure that feels like escape velocity. Omega's space rock is less noisy and more panoramic, prioritizing melody as atmosphere.

**Space Art — Onyx (Onyx (single), 1977)**
Space rock's futurism often runs through keyboards and synthetic rhythm, and 'Onyx' is an early, sleek European example. It translates the genre's 'otherworldly' aim into tight, electronic propulsion rather than guitar sprawl.

**Here & Now — Grate Fire of London (Give and Take, 1978)**
A long-form live-in-the-studio trip where communal improvisation becomes sustained orbital drift. The track's floating synth washes and groove-first build embody the 'festival' strand of space rock that later underground scenes revived.

**Rockets — On the Road Again (On the Road Again, 1978)**
Rockets refine space rock into a retro-futurist pop-rock machine: mechanical beats, bright synths, and astronaut theatre. The track is crucial for showing the genre's parallel evolution into European 'cosmic disco' and synth-rock.

**Planet Gong — Opium for the People (Live Floating Anarchy 1977, 1978)**
Where Gong's mythology meets Here & Now's engine-room groove, producing a direct line to later spacerock collectives. The chantlike repetition and synth-swirled momentum are textbook 'hypnotic travel' space rock.

**Hawklords — 25 Years (25 Years On, 1978)**
A Hawkwind offshoot that keeps the band's starship momentum while sharpening the song into a propulsive anthem. It captures the 'space-boogie' engine room—riff, pulse, and sci-fi attitude—without the indulgence of a full jam.

**Eloy — Time to Turn (Time to Turn, 1982)**
Eloy's 'cosmic concept' approach pushes space rock toward cinematic prog without losing the genre's core of suspended, starfield atmosphere. The title track's narrative arc and synth-led orchestration make it a flagship of early-80s space rock.

## C. Second-Wave Takeoff (1988–1992)

**Loop — Pulse (Fade Out, 1988)**
Loop translate space rock into post-punk volume: cyclic riffs, locked-in drums, and a sense of forward thrust rather than prog virtuosity. 'Pulse' is a textbook example of how the genre's 'hypnosis' can be achieved with brute economy.

**Spacemen 3 — Revolution (Playing with Fire, 1989)**
A cornerstone of the late-80s revival: one chord, huge reverb, and a narcotic groove that turns repetition into 'deep space'. Its druggy minimalism set a template for drone-leaning space rock in the 1990s.

**Ozric Tentacles — Saucers (Erpland, 1990)**
Ozric's signature blend—liquid guitar, bubbling synths, and dance-like momentum—turns space rock into a bright, ecstatic 'festival cosmics' form. 'Saucers' is both virtuosic and groove-anchored, a key 90s spacerock reference point.

**The Telescopes — Flying (Flying (single), 1991)**
A Creation-era classic where swirling guitars and a steady, motoric feel create the sensation of lift-off. It captures the point where psychedelic noise and space rock converged into a distinctive early-90s UK sound.

**Eat Static — Abnormal Interference (Abnormal Interference, 1992)**
Space rock doesn't have to be guitar-led; Eat Static bring cosmic imagery and 'alien' sound design into a rock-adjacent, propulsion-focused form. The track's synthetic textures and relentless motion sit squarely in the spacerock continuum.

**Porcupine Tree — Voyage 34 (Phase I) (Voyage 34: The Complete Trip, 1992)**
A modern classic of 'headphone space rock': long-form psychedelia fused to trance-like sequencing and narrative spoken-word. It demonstrated a new route for the genre—psychedelic travel music built from studio architecture.

## D. Revival, Drone, and Heavy-Cosmic Crossovers (1991–2004)

**Monster Magnet — Tab... 25 (Tab, 1991)**
A long, narcotic jam that treats the studio as a vehicle for sustained 'cosmic travel'—riff fragments orbiting around a hypnotic center. Its commitment to duration and drugged propulsion links 70s space-boogie to 90s heavy-psych revival.

**Sleep — Marijuanaut's Theme (Sleep's Holy Mountain, 1992)**
Even within doom's weight, this track drifts: wah-soaked guitars and a hazy, near-instrumental glide suggest 'space' as altered perception. It's an influential bridge between slow heavy rock and the later wave of cosmic riff-psych.

**Kyuss — Space Cadet (Blues for the Red Sun, 1992)**
A stoner-adjacent band's most space-rock moment: hushed vocals, phased guitar and a slow-floating pulse that prioritizes atmosphere over riffing. It shows how 'desert' heaviness could flip into genuine interstellar calm.

**Catherine Wheel — Black Metallic (Ferment, 1992)**
A shoegaze-adjacent track where space rock manifests as enormous spatial depth—sustained guitar layers and a sense of forward glide. It became a key reference for later 'spacey' alternative rock that kept the cosmic feel without prog traits.

**The Verve — Slide Away (A Storm in Heaven, 1993)**
Early Verve space rock is built from elongated grooves, tremolo guitar, and 'open sky' harmonics rather than Britpop hooks. This track is a canonical example of the UK's early-90s turn from psychedelic rock into true spacerock drift.

**Slowdive — Souvlaki Space Station (Souvlaki, 1993)**
A literal 'space station' anthem in sound: submerged vocals, modular synth-like guitars, and a slow orbiting chord cycle. It demonstrates how space rock's core idea—ecstatic suspension—can be achieved through minimal harmonic motion.

**Spectrum — How You Satisfy Me (Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows, 1994)**
Sonic Boom turns the Spacemen 3 drone into a warmer, melodic 'space-pop' that still lives on repetition and shimmer. It's pivotal for mapping space rock's migration into indie and shoegaze-adjacent territories without losing the cosmic haze.

**Hum — Stars (You'd Prefer an Astronaut, 1995)**
A definitive 'alt space rock' single: huge, chorus-drenched guitars and a buoyant, floating hook that feels planetary rather than terrestrial. Its combination of heaviness and lift shaped a generation of guitar bands chasing cosmic scale.

**Flying Saucer Attack — Rainstorm Blues (Further, 1995)**
A defining statement of 'space rock as weather system': blurred acoustic strums, buried melodies, and vast reverb that feels like distance itself. It helped open a quieter, drone-folk route through the genre that countless ambient-psych acts followed.

**Bowery Electric — Postscript (Beat, 1996)**
A slow-motion blend of guitars and electronics that turns 'space' into pure sonic architecture: spacious bass, dubby echo, and weightless pacing. It's a key crossover point where space rock absorbs trip-hop's sense of depth.

**Failure — Stuck on You (Fantastic Planet, 1996)**
Failure's clean, wide mix and gliding riffing helped define 90s space rock as a production aesthetic—compression, reverb, and 'vacuum' clarity. The song distills the genre into a tight, radio-ready form without losing the starfield mood.

**Bardo Pond — Tommy Gun Angel (Bufo Alvarius, 1996)**
Bardo Pond's approach is space rock as psychedelic endurance: long, saturating guitars and a trance pulse that invites 'travel'. The track's devotional length and timbral density are hallmarks of the American cosmic underground.

**The Brian Jonestown Massacre — Anemone (Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request, 1996)**
A neo-psychedelic staple that channels 60s cosmic rock into a slow, reverbed float—space rock as languid orbit. Its influence is heard across later space-psych and 'cosmic Americana' scenes.

**Stereolab — Metronomic Underground (Emperor Tomato Ketchup, 1996)**
Stereolab channel the 'motorik-to-space' pathway into a pop-intelligent groove, using repetition and timbre to generate lift. It's crucial for showing how space rock's hypnotic engine can sit inside art-pop structures.

**Mogwai — Mogwai Fear Satan (Young Team, 1997)**
A post-rock track that functions like classic space rock: long arc, slow ignition, and overwhelming 'widescreen' climax built from sustained tones. Its sense of scale and drift influenced later instrumental spacerock scenes.

**Spiritualized — Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, 1997)**
Space rock's ecstatic side—gospel harmonies and orchestral swell—still hinges on the genre's key gesture: suspension, weightlessness, and the sense of limitless horizon. Few tracks made 'cosmic transcendence' feel as immediate and modern.

**Sigur Rós — Svefn-g-englar (Ágætis byrjun, 1999)**
Sigur Rós turn space rock into pure atmosphere—glacial harmonies and bowed-guitar sustain that feels like gravity weakening. The track's vast, slowly unfolding form became a touchstone for 'cosmic' rock beyond the prog lineage.

**Godspeed You! Black Emperor — Storm (Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, 2000)**
Space rock's long-form tradition reimagined as cinematic post-rock: recurring motifs, distant samples, and a sense of 'travelogue through void'. It makes the case that space rock can be as much about structure and duration as timbre.

**Muse — Space Dementia (Origin of Symmetry, 2001)**
Muse translate cosmic grandiosity into modern, high-drama rock with cathedral-sized arrangements and a distinctly 'astral' harmonic language. It's a mainstream example of space rock's fixation on scale, drama, and vertigo.

**The Flaming Lips — Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia) (Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, 2002)**
A late-career space rock masterpiece that builds a whole planetary scene from melody, synthesizer glow, and slow-turning rhythm. It shows the genre's pop-psychedelic side: wonder, distance, and childlike cosmology.

**The Warlocks — Shake the Dope Out (Phoenix Album, 2003)**
A long-form neo-psych sprawl where the 'space' comes from repetition, reverb, and the slow accretion of intensity. It helped define 00s 'space-psych' as a living continuation of 90s drone-based spacerock.

**M83 — Run Into Flowers (Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts, 2003)**
Here space rock arrives via shoegaze electronics: saturated guitars, synth choirs, and a slow-motion lift that feels like floating. It's a key early-00s statement of 'space rock as dream-pop propulsion.'

**Oceansize — One Day All This Could Be Yours (Effloresce, 2003)**
Oceansize fuse post-hardcore dynamics with space rock's panoramic harmonies and long-form pacing. The song's quiet-to-loud trajectory reads as launch, drift, and re-entry—space rock dramaturgy in modern guise.

**Explosions in the Sky — Your Hand in Mine (The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place, 2003)**
Though tagged post-rock, its emotional 'widescreen' build and shimmering guitar sustain function as space rock's most accessible vocabulary. It helped popularize instrumental 'cosmic lift' as a mainstream rock affect.

**The Mars Volta — Cicatriz ESP (De-Loused in the Comatorium, 2003)**
A modern prog-psych epic whose extended improvisational sections and swirling production evoke 'space' as disorientation and velocity. The track revives 70s cosmic excess in a contemporary, high-energy language.

**Comets on Fire — The Bee and the Fly (Blue Cathedral, 2004)**
A modern heavy-psych cut that earns the 'space rock' tag through its spiraling guitar figures and sense of runaway momentum. The track's ecstatic noise and forward drive echo the Hawkwind tradition in a contemporary, fuzzed-out dialect.

**Amplifier — Motorhead (Amplifier, 2004)**
A heavy, riff-forward take on space rock that still prioritizes depth and forward glide over blues crunch. Amplifier's production—big room, wide stereo, and sustained tones—captures early-00s UK space rock's modernized power.

**Secret Machines — Nowhere Again (Now Here Is Nowhere, 2004)**
A key early-00s revival anthem that marries kraut-pulse discipline (without the genre's stylistic baggage) to soaring, space-open guitars. Its propulsion-and-haze balance made it a reference point for modern 'spacerock' bands.

**Maserati — Kalimera (Inventions for the New Season, 2004)**
Instrumental space rock distilled into motion: bright guitar figures, driving rhythm, and an 'endless road' feel that reads as interplanetary travel. Maserati helped cement the 00s instrumental spacerock circuit outside prog scenes.

## E. 21st-Century Global Spacerock (2005–2025)

**Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra — God Bless Our Dead Marines (Horses in the Sky, 2005)**
A hymn-like, slowly escalating piece that turns repetition into a sense of vast terrain—space rock's long-form immersion translated into chamber-rock intensity. Its communal crescendo echoes the genre's 'travel' narratives without any sci-fi literalism.

**God Is an Astronaut — All Is Violent, All Is Bright (All Is Violent, All Is Bright, 2005)**
A definitive modern instrumental spacerock anthem: clean delay lines, arcing melody, and a sense of lift-off built from repetition. It helped codify the 2000s 'spacerock' sound as emotional, cinematic, and riff-minimal.

**Black Mountain — Stormy High (Black Mountain, 2005)**
A heavy-psych track whose slow surge and cosmic harmonies feel built for night-sky listening. It shows 00s space rock's return to fuzz and organ while keeping the genre's essential spaciousness.

**65daysofstatic — Radio Protector (One Time for All Time, 2005)**
Space rock by way of math-rock and electronics: looping figures and synthetic atmospheres create a 'launch sequence' sense of momentum. The track illustrates how 21st-century space rock often lives in texture and motion rather than sci-fi lyrics.

**Red Sparowes — Buildings Began to Stretch Wide Across the Sky, and the Clouds Began to Curl and Swirl (At the Soundless Dawn, 2005)**
A widescreen instrumental that treats repetition and gradual escalation as a form of travel—core space rock logic in post-rock clothing. Its sense of scale and distance made it influential across modern cosmic instrumental scenes.

**Angels & Airwaves — The Adventure (We Don't Need to Whisper, 2006)**
A mainstream example of 'arena space rock': huge reverbs, sustained guitar lines, and a soaring, weightless chorus. It shows how the genre's 'widescreen' production aesthetic migrated into 2000s alt rock.

**The Black Angels — Young Men Dead (Passover, 2006)**
A neo-psych banger that earns 'space rock' through its swirling organ, tremolo guitars, and relentless forward pull. The track helped define the 00s garage-psych → space-psych pipeline.

**Russian Circles — Harper Lewis (Enter, 2006)**
Instrumental rock with a clear space-travel arc: patient build, repeating motifs, and a climactic burst that feels like breaking orbit. Its disciplined pacing reflects space rock's long tradition of dynamic 'launch and drift' forms.

**Jesu — Silver (Silver, 2006)**
A slow, luminous glide where distortion becomes ambience—space rock as density and suspension rather than riffing. The track helped shape the 'cosmic shoegaze / space-metal' edge of 00s spacerock.

**Hammock — Turn Away and Return (Raising Your Voice... Trying to Stop an Echo, 2006)**
Space rock pushed into pure atmosphere: guitar reverbs and ambient haze that feel like weightless drift. It's important for the ambient-spacerock continuum, where 'space' is literally the mix's depth and air.

**Zombi — Surface to Air (Surface to Air, 2006)**
Zombi's synth-driven approach treats space rock as retro-futurist soundtrack music: arpeggiated keys, pulsing rhythm, and a sense of orbital motion. It's a key node in the modern 'cosmic instrumental' network linking rock and electronic timbre.

**Boris — Farewell (Pink, 2006)**
A slow, glowing piece where distortion and melody hang in suspension—space rock as a floating mass rather than a riff. Boris show how the genre's 'otherworldly' affect can emerge from drone and tone-control as much as from prog structure.

**Om — State of Non-Return (Conference of the Birds, 2006)**
A slow, mantra-like piece where repetition and resonance create a 'cosmic' sense of scale—space rock's hypnosis translated into heavy minimalism. It's influential for the later wave of bands blending spiritual drone with interstellar ambience.

**Yndi Halda — Dash and Blast (Enjoy Eternal Bliss, 2006)**
A long, patient build that treats time as the main instrument—very much in space rock's tradition of duration as immersion. Its radiant climax exemplifies the 'astral' emotional payoff later instrumental spacerock acts chased.

**A Place to Bury Strangers — Keep Slipping Away (Exploding Head, 2007)**
A noise-psych eruption where space rock manifests as sheer spatial smear—echo, feedback, and a forward-driving pulse. It's a key example of space rock's compatibility with post-punk volume and shoegaze density.

**Earthless — Uluru Rock (From the Ages, 2007)**
A modern guitar-hero approach to space rock: long-form instrumental travel powered by improvisation and psychedelic tone. The track demonstrates the genre's endurance as a vehicle for extended 'cosmic jam' tradition.

**This Will Destroy You — The Mighty Rio Grande (This Will Destroy You, 2008)**
A modern classic of 'cosmic instrumental' rock: simple motifs, enormous reverbs, and an emotional arc built on slow expansion. It helped popularize space rock's sense of scale in the streaming era.

**Maybeshewill — Not for Want of Trying (Not for Want of Trying, 2008)**
Post-rock with a distinct space-rock core: repetition, gradual ignition, and a mix that emphasizes distance and altitude. Its cinematic pacing and textural focus echo the genre's long-form, trance-ready history.

**Motorpsycho — Vortex Surfer (Little Lucid Moments, 2008)**
Motorpsycho's prog-psych engine locks into a true space-rock groove—rolling momentum, swirling textures, and a sense of endless forward motion. The track bridges Scandinavian psych-prog and modern spacerock's widescreen feel.

**The Horrors — Sea Within a Sea (Primary Colours, 2009)**
A modern psych epic that explicitly foregrounds space rock traits: motoric drive, phased textures, and extended form. Its success showed that 'cosmic' long-tracks could still function in contemporary indie rock.

**Long Distance Calling — Apparitions (Avoid the Light, 2009)**
A precise, melodic instrumental that treats riffs as orbital patterns—repeated, transformed, and enlarged. It's influential for the European 'instrumental spacerock' scene that prizes clarity and momentum.

**MONO — Ashes in the Snow (Hymn to the Immortal Wind, 2009)**
An orchestral-minded instrumental that achieves 'space' through sustained tones and slow gravitational pull. It demonstrates how modern spacerock can be cinematic without losing the genre's hypnotic continuity.

**Caspian — Ghosts of the Garden City (Tertia, 2009)**
A clean, melodic form of instrumental space rock where delay, repetition, and wide dynamics create a sense of travel. Caspian's approach helped define the 'uplifting' strand of 00s/10s spacerock.

**Moon Duo — Sleepwalker (Mazes, 2011)**
A hypnotic, cycling groove built for altered-state travel: minimal harmony, maximum motion, and plenty of 'air' in the sound. It reflects the 2010s neo-psych turn toward space rock's repetitive engine.

**Majeure — Timespan (Timespan, 2011)**
A synth-forward instrumental that leans into the genre's 'sci-fi soundtrack' lineage without leaving rock dynamics behind. It's a modern example of space rock as propulsion plus sound-design.

**Sungrazer — Common Believer (Sungrazer, 2011)**
A modern space-psych staple that balances riff energy with a floating, effects-rich soundstage. Its extended, sun-burnt drift is a key example of how 2010s space rock absorbed heavier psych while keeping the 'travel' feeling primary.

**If These Trees Could Talk — Barren Lands of the Modern Dinosaur (Red Forest, 2012)**
A wide-angle instrumental whose slow build and layered guitars create the sensation of vastness. It demonstrates how space rock's core affect—distance, scale, suspension—remains portable across modern instrumental rock.

**Tame Impala — Apocalypse Dreams (Lonerism, 2012)**
A neo-psychedelic suite that translates space rock into pop-psych: swirling stereo, phased guitars, and a feeling of endless horizon. The track is crucial for the 2010s mainstreaming of 'cosmic' production aesthetics.

**Thee Oh Sees — The Dream (Floating Coffin, 2013)**
A high-energy take where space rock is felt in the relentless forward drive and swirling timbre, not slow drift. It shows the genre can be frantic and 'rocket-fueled' while still sounding interstellar.

**Wooden Shjips — Lazy Bones (Back to Land, 2013)**
Wooden Shjips specialize in space rock as steady-state cruising: repeating patterns, reverb sheen, and a patient, narcotic tempo. 'Lazy Bones' is a near-perfect modern example of 'cosmic drift' songwriting.

**Lumerians — Dogon Genesis (The High Frontier, 2013)**
A dense, synthesizer-laced psych track that feels like a lost sci-fi soundtrack cue. It exemplifies the 2010s 'space-psych' style where groove, synth color, and ritual repetition do the worldbuilding.

**Föllakzoid — Electric (Föllakzoid, 2013)**
A modern motoric cosmos: a locked groove and shimmering layers that generate a sense of forward travel. The track is a touchstone for the South American psychedelic scene's contribution to contemporary space rock.

**Monkey3 — Icarus (Icarus, 2013)**
Instrumental space rock at stadium scale—big themes, long arcs, and a clear narrative of ascent and fall. It's representative of the 2010s European wave that fused prog structure to spacerock atmosphere.

**Yuri Gagarin — At the Center of All Infinity (At the Center of All Infinity, 2013)**
A modern flagship for instrumental spacerock: thick synths, driving drums, and a sense of cosmic journey without vocals. Named for an astronaut icon, it makes the genre's sci-fi imagination sound immediate again.

**We Lost the Sea — A Gallant Gentleman (Departure Songs, 2015)**
A long narrative instrumental whose slow build and soaring release evoke space rock's 'journey' archetype in contemporary post-rock language. Its scale and emotional spaciousness have made it a modern cult touchstone.

**Public Service Broadcasting — Gagarin (The Race for Space, 2015)**
A pop-structured piece that still feels like space rock because the production is pure lift—wide reverbs, motoric pulse, and archival cosmonaut grandeur. It's a modern example of space rock's enduring fascination with real-world space history.

**Pond — Man It Feels Like Space Again (Man It Feels Like Space Again, 2015)**
A title-track mission statement: swirling synths and guitars create an explicitly 'cosmic' indie-psych space. It shows how 2010s neo-psychedelia often re-approached space rock through studio sheen and daydream propulsion.

**Kikagaku Moyo — Dripping Sun (House in the Tall Grass, 2016)**
A modern psych jam where extended form, cyclic riffing, and timbral shimmer create true 'cosmic travel' feel. Its spacious mix and patient development are classic space rock virtues in contemporary clothing.

**Psychedelic Porn Crumpets — Found God in a Tomato (High Visceral, Pt. 1, 2016)**
A contemporary psych epic that behaves like space rock: extended form, head-spinning transitions, and a sense of tumbling through environments. Its blend of drive and hallucination typifies 2010s 'space-psych' virtuosity.

**The Claypool Lennon Delirium — Blood and Rockets: Movement I, Saga of Jack Parsons / Movement II, Too the Moon (Monolith of Phobos, 2016)**
A modern prog-psych suite built around space-age mythology and sustained groove—space rock's storytelling and long-form ambition in one piece. The track's orbiting riffs and synth colors are explicitly 'astronautic' in spirit.

**Elder — Sanctuary (Reflections of a Floating World, 2017)**
Elder stretch heavy psych into true space rock via long arcs, luminous lead lines, and a sense of continuous forward glide. The track exemplifies modern 'cosmic prog' that prioritizes atmosphere and journey over genre orthodoxy.

**King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard — Crumbling Castle (Polygondwanaland, 2017)**
A late-2010s prog-psych epic that channels space rock through shifting sections and expansive, reverbed guitar-synth textures. It shows the genre's long-form ambition returning in a new generation of psych-prog bands.

**Slift — Ummon (Ummon, 2020)**
A modern space rock monolith: relentless motor, massive fuzz, and sci-fi grandeur that feels like piloting a ship at maximum thrust. The track demonstrates how contemporary bands reconcile heaviness with genuine 'cosmic' atmosphere.

**Beach House — Space Song (Depression Cherry, 2015)**
While rooted in dream-pop, this track's defining feature is its 'weightless' space—slow pulse, starfield synths, and suspended melody. It illustrates how space rock aesthetics continue to shape 2010s guitar-and-synth atmospherics.

**And So I Watch You from Afar — Set Guitars to Kill (And So I Watch You from Afar, 2009)**
A bright, kinetic instrumental where tightly looping lines create the feeling of forward flight. It represents a modern, upbeat spacerock strain that swaps narcotic drift for rocket-like momentum while keeping the panoramic guitar sound.
