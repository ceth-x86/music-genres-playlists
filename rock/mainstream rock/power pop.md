# Power Pop

## Proto-Blueprint and Solidification 1968–1975

**Nazz — Open My Eyes (Nazz, 1968)**
A muscular, Who‑influenced riff and bright vocal harmonies make this one of the clearest pre‑1970 blueprints for power pop's "loud but sweet" balance. It matters because it helped codify the idea that a three‑minute pop hook could hit with hard‑rock force.

**Badfinger — No Matter What (No Dice, 1970)**
The chorus hits with arena-sized crunch while the verses keep a Beatlesque melodic glide, a textbook power-pop push-pull. As an early 70s benchmark, it showed labels and bands how hookcraft could coexist with genuine rock weight.

**Emitt Rhodes — Fresh as a Daisy (Emitt Rhodes, 1970)**
Home-studio Beatles-pop precision, stacked harmonies, and tight guitar punctuation deliver pure power-pop concision. It's influential as a DIY model: meticulous melody-first rock without sacrificing punch.

**The Move — Do Ya (California Man / Do Ya (single), 1972)**
A compressed riff-rocker with a pop-sensible chorus, this track captures the proto power-pop idea of turning hard-rock energy into a singable hook. It's important for bridging late-60s/early-70s British rock into the later, codified power-pop sound.

**Todd Rundgren — Couldn't I Just Tell You (Something/Anything?, 1972)**
A masterclass in tight arrangement: chiming guitars, stacked vocals, and a chorus that lands instantly without excess. Rundgren's solo turn also proved power pop could be clever and studio-savvy without losing immediacy.

**Raspberries — Go All the Way (Raspberries, 1972)**
Big guitars, a huge hook, and swooning vocal harmonies distill the core power-pop recipe into a single, unmistakable statement. It's historically central as a template track for the genre's early-70s identity.

**Blue Ash — Abracadabra (Have You Seen Her?) (No More, No Less, 1973)**
Riff-forward and urgent but built around bright, instantly memorable melodic turns, it's the kind of regional-American power pop that feels both tough and sugary. Its cult status helped define the Midwest thread of the genre's 70s development.

**Pilot — Just a Smile (From the Album of the Same Name, 1974)**
Polished harmonies and a buoyant, guitar-led pulse deliver radio-ready euphoria with classic pop structure and rock instrumentation. It's a key example of the "power" turned into shine rather than heaviness.

**Big Star — September Gurls (Radio City, 1974)**
Jangling guitars and bittersweet melody fuse euphoria with ache, one of power pop's defining emotional contradictions. Its long influence runs through decades of guitar-pop writers chasing the same mix of clarity and yearning.

**Tim Moore — Rock and Roll Love Letter (Behind the Eyes, 1975)**
Built like a perfect single—tight chords, clean melodic lift, and no wasted seconds—this is pure power-pop craft. It also became a reference point for how songwriter-led power pop could feed band-driven scenes.

**Dwight Twilley Band — I'm on Fire (Sincerely, 1975)**
A concise blast of riffing and harmony with a distinctly American snap, balancing swagger with pop clarity. Twilley's work is foundational for the genre's heartland strain and later retro-revivalists.

**Artful Dodger — Wayside (Artful Dodger, 1975)**
Chiming guitars and crisp vocal blend make the song feel like FM rock refined into pop-scale structure. It's emblematic of mid-70s U.S. bands translating British Invasion DNA into modern, guitar-forward hooks.

## First Wave Breakthrough 1976–1979

**Flamin' Groovies — Shake Some Action (Shake Some Action, 1976)**

**Bram Tchaikovsky — Girl of My Dreams (Strange Man, Changed Man, 1979)**
A crisp, melodic rocker that keeps the focus on hook delivery and vocal lift rather than style crossover. It represents the UK edge of the genre: taut, witty, and built like a perfect single.
