# Avant-Pop

## Pioneering & Proto‑Avant Pop (1973–1979)

**Roxy Music — In Every Dream Home a Heartache (For Your Pleasure, 1973)**
A pop song stretched into art‑school theatre: glamorous surfaces, unsettling narrative, and a slow‑burn structure that refuses conventional verse‑chorus payoff. Its blend of seduction and disquiet became a template for avant pop's taste for concept and sonic mise‑en‑scène.

**Todd Rundgren — International Feel (A Wizard, a True Star, 1973)**
Rundgren treats the studio like a kaleidoscope, splicing bright pop hooks into abrupt scene changes and timbral left turns. It's an early statement of "pop as collage," a key avant‑pop method for making experimentation feel singable.

**Kraftwerk — Autobahn (Autobahn, 1974)**
A long‑form electronic piece that still thinks like pop: memorable motifs, buoyant melodic cells, and an everyday concept rendered futuristic. Its clean, mechanized romanticism is foundational for later avant pop that treats technology as both sound and subject.

**Brian Eno — Third Uncle (Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy), 1974)**
Motorik momentum and jagged guitar lines are organized like a pop single but destabilized by Eno's oblique arrangements and vocal persona. It shows how avant pop can keep immediacy while re‑wiring rock's sound palette into something stranger and more synthetic.

**Sparks — This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us (Kimono My House, 1974)**
Operatic melodrama, hyper‑precise phrasing, and a knowingly artificial arrangement turn pop into high‑camp performance art. Sparks' theatrical modernism helped define avant pop's embrace of exaggeration, irony, and "constructed" emotion.

**10cc — I'm Not in Love (The Original Soundtrack, 1975)**
Built from meticulously layered vocal loops, it reframes a soft pop ballad as a studio‑driven hallucination. The track's production-as-composition approach is central to avant pop's idea that "how it's made" can be the hook.

**David Bowie — Sound and Vision (Low, 1977)**
A pop song hollowed out into negative space: clipped lyrics, uncanny harmonies, and a groove that feels like modernist design. Bowie's Berlin‑era minimalism is a blueprint for avant pop that values texture, mood, and restraint over conventional climax.

**Suicide — Cheree (Suicide, 1977)**
Primitive drum machine pulses and stark, romantic vocals reduce pop to its bare emotional circuitry. Its abrasive simplicity opened a path for avant pop that uses minimal means to create maximal psychological tension.

**The Normal — Warm Leatherette (Warm Leatherette (single), 1978)**
Minimal synth pop reduced to machine rhythm, deadpan delivery, and transgressive imagery. Its starkness anticipates avant pop's later interest in industrial textures and the aesthetics of cool detachment.

**The Residents — Constantinople (Duck Stab!, 1978)**
A nursery‑rhyme sing‑song set inside warped, cartoonish sound design—pop's familiarity turned uncanny. The Residents model an avant‑pop tactic: using catchiness as a vehicle for surrealism and conceptual play.

**The Buggles — Video Killed the Radio Star (The Age of Plastic, 1979)**
Meta‑pop that makes media theory feel like a chart single: glossy synth textures, nostalgia, and self‑reflexive storytelling. Its conceptual framing—pop about pop—became a recurring avant‑pop strategy.

**Lene Lovich — Lucky Number (Stateless, 1979)**
Lovich's elastic vocal quirks and the track's twitchy arrangement turn new‑wave pop into something skewed and theatrical. It's a model for avant pop that foregrounds persona and vocal timbre as experimental instruments.

**Tubeway Army — Are 'Friends' Electric? (Replicas, 1979)**
A cold, sci‑fi narrative delivered with pop tension and a hypnotic electronic pulse. It shows avant pop's knack for turning dystopian concepts into mainstream‑readable choruses and riffs.

**The B‑52's — Rock Lobster (The B‑52's, 1979)**
Camp, collage, and party music meet art‑damaged vocal performance, turning a danceable single into a dadaist vignette. Its playful deconstruction of pop tropes is a key early example of avant pop's humor and stylization.

**Yellow Magic Orchestra — Rydeen (Solid State Survivor, 1979)**
Bright melodic synth lines and videogame‑like timbres compress futurism into irresistibly hummable pop logic. YMO's blend of precision electronics and hookcraft shaped avant pop's later fascination with "synthetic" joy.

## The Avant‑Pop Expansion (1980–1989)

**Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark — Enola Gay (Organisation, 1980)**
A buoyant melody carrying dark subject matter, with stark electronic arrangement that keeps the song oddly weightless. OMD show how avant pop can smuggle conceptual themes into bright, efficient pop architecture.

**Devo — Girl U Want (Freedom of Choice, 1980)**
A pop song rendered as satire: rigid grooves, synthetic timbres, and robotic affect. Devo crystallize avant pop's use of irony and "de-evolution" to critique pop even while delivering it.

**Peter Gabriel — Intruder (Peter Gabriel 3 (Melt), 1980)**
A claustrophobic narrative staged through unusual drum sounds and a deliberately unsettling mix. Gabriel shows how avant pop can be cinematic and psychological—pop songwriting framed like a short film.

**Talking Heads — Once in a Lifetime (Remain in Light, 1980)**
Polyrhythmic layering and cut‑up lyrical logic turn a pop song into a trance-like ritual. It's central to avant pop's lineage of using groove and repetition to make experimental structure feel ecstatic rather than academic.

**Tom Tom Club — Genius of Love (Tom Tom Club, 1981)**
A bright, self-referential pop-funk construction whose rhythmic minimalism and playful cut-up sensibility point forward to sampling culture. Its modular groove and knowingly "made" feel are core to avant pop's lineage of pop as assemblage.

**Japan — Ghosts (Tin Drum, 1981)**
Sparse synth textures and heightened melodrama create an elegant, alienated pop ballad. The track's poise—experimental ambience inside a pop silhouette—became influential for later art-pop vocalists and producers.

**Klaus Nomi — Total Eclipse (Klaus Nomi, 1981)**
Operatic countertenor meets synth-pop staging, collapsing "high" and "low" into a single, uncanny pop event. Nomi's aesthetic fusion is pure avant pop: theatrical modernism packaged as a song.

**Yoko Ono — Walking on Thin Ice (Walking on Thin Ice (single), 1981)**
A danceable pop pulse paired with raw, avant-garde vocal presence and an edge of unease. Ono's mix of vulnerability and experimentation helped legitimize an avant-pop space for extreme vocals inside accessible grooves.

**Laurie Anderson — O Superman (Big Science, 1982)**
A minimalist vocal loop becomes an epic pop spell, blurring performance art and radio-friendly repetition. Its cool, conceptual intimacy is a cornerstone for avant pop's bridge between gallery culture and mass listening.

**Thomas Dolby — She Blinded Me with Science (The Golden Age of Wireless, 1982)**
A laboratory of synth timbres and spoken asides packaged as a hooky single. Dolby demonstrates a core avant-pop move: turning sound design and nerdy conceptual framing into pop pleasure.

**Kate Bush — The Dreaming (The Dreaming, 1982)**
A whirlwind of sampled voices, abrupt edits, and theatrical storytelling that still revolves around a pop sense of hook and character. It's a textbook demonstration of avant pop: maximal imagination disciplined into song form.

**Malcolm McLaren — Buffalo Gals (Duck Rock, 1983)**
An early pop collision of hip-hop techniques, found sound, and global references, assembled like a mixtape. It anticipates avant pop's later "sampled cosmopolitanism," where genre boundaries become raw material.

**New Order — Blue Monday (Blue Monday (non‑album single), 1983)**
A club track built with pop clarity but extended, mechanized, and structurally odd for a single. Its hybrid of dance-floor pragmatism and formal experimentation is essential to avant pop's electronic branch.

**The Art of Noise — Close (to the Edit) (Who's Afraid of the Art of Noise?, 1984)**
Sampling and aggressive editing become the main musical material, turning pop into a percussive collage. It helped normalize "cut-and-paste" composition in pop, a key technique in the genre's later experimental waves.

**Cabaret Voltaire — Sensoria (Micro-Phonies, 1984)**
Post-industrial textures and hypnotic repetition reframe pop as a pressure system of rhythm and timbre. It's influential for avant pop that leans into machine funk and the aesthetics of surveillance and control.

**Prince — When Doves Cry (Purple Rain, 1984)**
A mainstream hit that quietly breaks pop rules—strange harmonic turns, spiky minimal funk, and a famously unconventional arrangement. Its success proved avant-pop impulses could sit at the center of mass culture without being diluted.

**Yello — Oh Yeah (Stella, 1985)**
Sound effects, deadpan vocals, and sleek grooves create a pop track that feels like sonic design. It's influential as an example of avant pop's playful artificiality—music built like an audio advertisement for an imaginary world.

**Grace Jones — Slave to the Rhythm (Slave to the Rhythm, 1985)**
A pop single treated as a montage: spoken interludes, radical mixing, and rhythmic recomposition around Jones' sculptural voice. It exemplifies avant pop's studio-as-edit-suite approach and its obsession with persona as architecture.

**Scritti Politti — The Sweetest Girl (Cupid & Psyche 85, 1985)**
Glossy surfaces hide a highly constructed, almost analytical pop craft—funk dissolved into immaculate synth detail. It's a landmark for avant pop's intellectualized take on pleasure and production sheen.

**Propaganda — Duel (A Secret Wish, 1985)**
Hard-edged electronics and dramatic vocal phrasing make the song feel like pop scored for a techno-thriller. Propaganda's precision production and cinematic tension are emblematic of avant pop's 1980s fascination with grand form built from synthetic detail.

**Depeche Mode — Stripped (Black Celebration, 1986)**
Industrial-leaning textures and stark sensuality create a pop song that feels engineered from noise and breath. It's a pivot point for darker, more textural avant pop that treats ambience and percussion as equal melodic partners.

**Sinéad O'Connor — Mandinka (The Lion and the Cobra, 1987)**
A fierce, percussive pop-rock performance that foregrounds vocal urgency and rhythmic attack over polish. O'Connor's intensity shows an avant-pop route rooted in interpretive extremity and unconventional emotional presentation.

**Pet Shop Boys — It's a Sin (Actually, 1987)**
Grand melodrama filtered through crisp electronic production and self-aware lyricism. The Pet Shop Boys refine an avant-pop trait: emotional excess presented with cool design, wit, and architectural arrangement.

**David Sylvian — Orpheus (Secrets of the Beehive, 1987)**
Luxurious harmony and precise restraint give the song a modernist, suspended quality that pushes beyond conventional adult-pop sentimentality. Sylvian's approach shows avant pop's "quiet" side: innovation through harmony, space, and tone.

**Neneh Cherry — Buffalo Stance (Raw Like Sushi, 1989)**
A pop-rap hybrid built from sharp hooks, rhythmic collage, and attitude as structure. It's important for avant pop's later interest in genre-mashing and persona-driven vocal montage.

## Global & Alternative Avant Pop (1990–1999)

**Enigma — Sadeness (Part I) (MCMXC a.D., 1990)**
Gregorian chant loops and programmed beats collide into a pop single that feels both ancient and synthetic. It's emblematic of 90s avant pop's fascination with sampling, cultural recombination, and studio fiction.

**Saint Etienne — Only Love Can Break Your Heart (Foxbase Alpha, 1991)**
A wistful pop melody reframed through dance rhythms and a knowingly curated retro-modern sound world. Saint Etienne exemplify avant pop's 90s turn toward quotation, pastiche, and critical nostalgia as compositional tools.

**Primal Scream — Loaded (Screamadelica, 1991)**
Rock band identity dissolves into a sample-led, mantra-like pop rave, built from repetition and atmosphere. It's a landmark for avant pop's porous boundary with club culture and its comfort with collage as songcraft.

**Stereo MC's — Connected (Connected, 1992)**
A pop-rap hybrid whose hook is as much rhythmic design as melody, balancing streetwise vocal delivery with slick, modular production. It shows how 90s avant pop absorbed hip-hop's cadence and studio architecture into accessible singles.

**PJ Harvey — Down by the Water (To Bring You My Love, 1995)**
Bluesy pop hooks are pushed into gothic theatre through stark production choices and a confrontational vocal performance. Harvey demonstrates an avant-pop route rooted in persona and dramatic framing rather than purely electronic experimentation.

**Underworld — Born Slippy .NUXX (Born Slippy (single), 1995)**
A rave catharsis that behaves like pop: a clear melodic core, dramatic build, and a hook you can shout. It helped bring club extremity into broader pop consciousness—an important bridge in avant pop's dance lineage.

**Cibo Matto — Sugar Water (Viva! La Woman, 1996)**
A playful pop song that flips itself—its famous reversal effect turning structure into concept. It's a perfect avant-pop example of making studio technique part of the composition's meaning.

**Beck — Where It's At (Odelay, 1996)**
Sampling, hip-hop grooves, and lo‑fi weirdness are organized into a radio-ready hook machine. Beck's bricolage approach helped mainstream the idea that genre fragments could coexist inside a single pop chassis.

**Tori Amos — Professional Widow (Boys for Pele, 1996)**
Amos turns piano-led pop into something volatile through abrupt dynamics, abrasive timbres, and character-driven vocal extremes. It's important for avant pop's singer-songwriter branch where performance and arrangement become experimental agents.

**Daft Punk — Around the World (Homework, 1997)**
A single phrase becomes a structural engine, with arrangement and timbral shifts carrying the narrative. Its disciplined repetition and sound design show a dance-floor form of avant pop: minimal lyric content, maximal sonic architecture.

**The Chemical Brothers — Block Rockin' Beats (Dig Your Own Hole, 1997)**
Big-beat maximalism reimagines pop impact as a collage of breaks, synth stabs, and sampled attitude. It marks a moment when experimental production values became the primary "hook," a recurring avant-pop principle.

**The Prodigy — Firestarter (The Fat of the Land, 1997)**
Aggressive electronic sound design and punkish vocal attitude turn a dance track into an anti-pop pop single. Its success opened space for avant pop that thrives on abrasion, distortion, and confrontational energy.

**Björk — Jóga (Homogenic, 1997)**
Orchestral swells and volcanic electronic beats fuse into a pop anthem that feels like modernist landscape painting. It's a defining avant-pop statement: emotionally direct songwriting delivered through radical sound-world design.

**Stereolab — Miss Modular (Dots and Loops, 1997)**
Stereolab fold lounge pop, kraut-inspired repetition, and meticulous studio detail into a tune that's both catchy and formally sly. The track is key to 90s indie avant pop: cool surfaces, brainy structure, undeniable hooks.

**Radiohead — Paranoid Android (OK Computer, 1997)**
A multi-part suite disguised as a rock single—abrupt sectional shifts, alienated melodicism, and studio manipulation. It's influential for avant pop's willingness to import progressive form and modernist mood into song-length statements.

**Cornelius — Star Fruits Surf Rider (Fantasma, 1997)**
A whirlwind of micro-edits and surf-pop allusions, assembled with the precision of a sound collage. Cornelius exemplifies late-90s avant pop as playful studio modernism—joyful, referential, and hyper-crafted.

**Air — Sexy Boy (Moon Safari, 1998)**
Soft-focus synth timbres and playful minimalism create a pop song that feels like a curated mood board. Air helped define a strand of avant pop where texture, restraint, and design-conscious nostalgia drive the hook.

**Madonna — Frozen (Ray of Light, 1998)**
A pop diva single rebuilt with spacious, electronic atmosphere and a darker, more cinematic harmonic language. It's a high-profile example of avant-pop technique—club and ambient sonics reshaping mainstream pop affect.

**Fiona Apple — Paper Bag (When the Pawn..., 1999)**
Off-kilter rhythms and unusually elastic phrasing push singer-led pop into intricate, nervous motion. Apple shows how avant pop can emerge from performance and meter, not just electronics—complexity made intimate.

**The Flaming Lips — Race for the Prize (The Soft Bulletin, 1999)**
A maximal pop anthem whose distorted drums and orchestral synth grandeur feel both celebratory and unstable. The Flaming Lips show how avant pop can be emotionally huge while still sounding like a constructed, slightly surreal studio object.

## Digital Art‑Pop & Indie Experimentation (2000–2009)

**The Avalanches — Frontier Psychiatrist (Since I Left You, 2000)**
A delirious sample mosaic that behaves like a pop song—catchphrases as hooks, montage as melody. It's a landmark for avant pop's plunderphonic imagination, where the archive becomes the instrument.

**Peaches — Fuck the Pain Away (The Teaches of Peaches, 2000)**
Electro minimalism and provocation turn sexuality and attitude into structural elements of the song. Peaches helped carve a space for avant pop that is confrontational, performance-centered, and proudly synthetic.

**Fischerspooner — Emerge (#1, 2001)**
High-gloss electronics framed as art performance, with a hooky chorus that still feels slightly alien. It captures early-2000s avant pop's club/gallery crossover—dance music as conceptual spectacle.

**Ladytron — Seventeen (Light & Magic, 2002)**
Cool, robotic vocal delivery and sharply angled synth lines make a pop song feel like modernist design. Ladytron exemplify avant pop's fascination with machinic affect—emotion expressed through restraint and texture.

**The Postal Service — Such Great Heights (Give Up, 2003)**
Indie songwriting filtered through crisp electronic sequencing, making intimacy feel digitized and luminous. Its success popularized an avant-pop-friendly idea: the laptop studio can be a pop band.

**Goldfrapp — Strict Machine (Black Cherry, 2003)**
A glam-industrial stomp where timbre and rhythm carry as much meaning as the lyric. It's a key 2000s avant-pop track for turning fetishistic sound design into an unmistakable pop identity.

**The Go! Team — Ladyflash (Thunder, Lightning, Strike, 2004)**
A collage of cheer chants, breakbeats, and TV-sampling energy that still lands like a perfect pop rush. It's important for avant pop's "hyperactive montage" approach—maximal references welded into hooky immediacy.

**Gorillaz — Feel Good Inc. (Demon Days, 2005)**
A cartoon-pop project that uses genre collision—hip-hop, dub, alt-pop—as the song's narrative engine. Its meta, hybrid construction embodies avant pop's comfort with assembled identities and virtual bandhood.

**Imogen Heap — Hide and Seek (Speak for Yourself, 2005)**
A pop ballad rebuilt from vocal processing, where harmony and timbre are one and the same. Heap shows how a single production concept can function as both emotional core and experimental method.

**Róisín Murphy — Ramalama (Bang Bang) (Ruby Blue, 2005)**
Murphy's vocal play and the track's skewed, percussive mix turn dance-pop into something eccentric and artful. It represents avant pop that treats the voice as a character actor inside a restless production.

**of Montreal — Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games (The Sunlandic Twins, 2005)**
Bright pop melodies are destabilized by baroque-yet-synthetic arranging tricks, sudden shifts, and theatrical singing. It's a defining indie avant-pop moment: maximal personality packed into meticulous pop craft.

**Hot Chip — Over and Over (The Warning, 2006)**
A deceptively simple pop mantra whose incremental layering and rhythmic precision create hypnosis. Hot Chip demonstrate an avant-pop virtue: minimal lyrical material, maximal attention to groove architecture.

**The Knife — Silent Shout (Silent Shout, 2006)**
Dark, cavernous electronics and fragmented hooks turn pop into a haunted physical space. It's a touchstone for 2000s avant pop that merges club sonics with emotional alienation and sound design theatrics.

**TV on the Radio — Wolf Like Me (Return to Cookie Mountain, 2006)**
A pop-leaning rock song supercharged by gospel-y intensity, jittery rhythm, and dense production layers. TV on the Radio show how avant pop can arrive through arrangement complexity and vocal architecture, not just genre labels.

**M.I.A. — Paper Planes (Kala, 2007)**
Global samples, blunt rhythmic hooks, and a disruptive "gunshot/cash register" gesture turn pop into cultural critique. It's a key avant-pop example of conceptual irony embedded directly in the sonic hook.

**MGMT — Time to Pretend (Oracular Spectacular, 2008)**
A stadium-sized chorus paired with self-sabotaging lyrics and a knowingly synthetic retro-futurist sound. MGMT's pop spectacle-with-a-wink is central to late-2000s avant pop's relationship with irony and nostalgia.

**Santigold — L.E.S. Artistes (Santigold, 2008)**
A pop song assembled from post-punk bounce, electronic polish, and sharp persona-driven delivery. It exemplifies avant pop's genre-fluid construction where vocal attitude and rhythmic framing define the style.

**Yeah Yeah Yeahs — Heads Will Roll (It's Blitz!, 2009)**
A rock band pivots into sleek, rhythmic pop without losing edge—synthetic drums and glossy tension powering the hook. It's significant for showing avant-pop aesthetics can reconfigure band identity through production alone.

**Fever Ray — If I Had a Heart (Fever Ray, 2009)**
A slow, ominous pop spell where vocal processing turns identity into something mutable. Fever Ray's minimalist dread and timbral focus define a strand of avant pop that is bodily, uncanny, and intensely textural.

**Animal Collective — My Girls (Merriweather Post Pavilion, 2009)**
Psychedelic harmony stacks and looping electronics transform a simple domestic lyric into ecstatic abstraction. It's a modern avant-pop anthem: communal, hooky, and built from studio-layered vocal architecture.

## Post‑Genre Avant Pop (2010–2019)

**tUnE-yArDs — Gangsta (w h o k i l l, 2011)**
A percussive, voice-led pop track that treats rhythm as collage—handclaps, loops, and vocal fragments snapping into a hook. tUnE-yArDs embody avant pop's DIY experimentalism where texture and groove are the main melodic story.

**Kimbra — Settle Down (Vows, 2011)**
A dense, rhythm-forward arrangement and idiosyncratic vocal phrasing turn a pop song into a percussive puzzle. It's a key 2010s example of avant pop's love of hyper-detailed vocal production and syncopated hookcraft.

**Grimes — Genesis (Visions, 2012)**
Lo-fi digital textures, bright melodies, and an elastic vocal persona create a pop song that feels like DIY futurism. Grimes helped define a new avant-pop archetype: bedroom production that still aims for pop maximalism.

**Janelle Monáe — Q.U.E.E.N. (The Electric Lady, 2013)**
A multi-section funk-pop statement that moves like a mini-suite while keeping the chorus punchy and quotable. Monáe exemplifies avant pop as world-building—concept, character, and genre-shifts in service of pop momentum.

**St. Vincent — Digital Witness (St. Vincent, 2014)**
Angular guitar lines and clipped rhythms turn pop into a machine with sharp edges and bright colors. St. Vincent shows avant pop's knack for making "weird" feel singable through immaculate arrangement control.

**Perfume Genius — Queen (Too Bright, 2014)**
A confrontational, theatrical pop anthem that builds power through staging and vocal character as much as melody. It's important for avant pop's queer-modernist thread: pop as self-mythology and declaration.

**Christine and the Queens — Tilted (Chaleur humaine, 2014)**
Rhythmic pop built around body-language phrasing—half-sung, half-spoken—paired with sleek electronic design. It captures avant pop's 2010s focus on performance and choreography as compositional ideas.

**FKA twigs — Two Weeks (LP1, 2014)**
A sensual pop structure warped by fractured beats, choral textures, and unusually sculpted vocal layering. It's a signature 2010s avant-pop blend of R&B intimacy and experimental sound design.

**Susanne Sundfør — Delirious (Ten Love Songs, 2015)**
A pop chorus large enough for the mainstream, framed by meticulous synth arrangement and harmonic sophistication. Sundfør represents an avant-pop ideal: virtuosity and emotional directness achieved through careful sonic architecture.

**Anohni — Drone Bomb Me (Hopelessness, 2016)**
Bright, almost childlike pop surfaces are weaponized to deliver brutal political and psychological content. The dissonance between sound and subject is a classic avant-pop technique—beauty used to intensify discomfort.

**Arca — Anoche (Arca, 2017)**
A tender pop core constantly destabilized by elastic bass, glitching edges, and fluid vocal treatment. Arca represents avant pop at its most body-focused: sound design used to reshape identity and intimacy in real time.

**SOPHIE — It's Okay to Cry (Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides, 2018)**
A disarmingly simple, heartfelt pop song rendered uncanny by hyperreal synthetic textures and precise vocal framing. It's pivotal for late-2010s avant pop that treats digital sound as an emotional, not just aesthetic, medium.

**ROSALÍA — Malamente (El mal querer, 2018)**
Traditional motifs and modern pop percussion collide in a tightly designed, concept-album context. ROSALÍA's approach exemplifies contemporary avant pop: cultural forms re-staged through bold production choices and sharp structural discipline.

**Billie Eilish — bury a friend (When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, 2019)**
ASMR-like details, negative space, and horror-pop sound design turn a mainstream song into a miniature installation. It's influential for a 2010s avant-pop wave where micro‑sonics and atmosphere become the hook.

**Caroline Polachek — So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings (Pang, 2019)**
Pristine pop writing paired with subtly surreal vocal harmonies and shimmering, slightly uncanny production. Polachek shows an avant-pop craft where experimentation lives inside precision—oddness engineered to feel effortless.

## Contemporary Avant Pop (2020–2025)

**Yves Tumor — Gospel for a New Century (Heaven to a Tortured Mind, 2020)**
A glammy pop refrain collides with ruptured electronics and sudden structural pivots, making the song feel like a radio hit from a parallel timeline. Yves Tumor captures 2020s avant pop's love of genre drag: borrowing pop iconography while destabilizing it from within.

**Rina Sawayama — XS (SAWAYAMA, 2020)**
A gleaming pop chorus that constantly mutates—metal riffs, R&B touches, and hyper-compressed production stitched into one statement. It's a modern avant-pop lesson in maximal genre-collision while staying fiercely hook-driven.

**Tirzah — Send Me (Colourgrade, 2021)**
Minimal, tactile production turns tiny vocal gestures and micro-rhythms into the song's emotional narrative. Tirzah represents an avant-pop craft where intimacy is engineered through detail, silence, and unorthodox sonic framing.

**Shygirl — Firefly (Nymph, 2022)**
A pop vocal line is embedded inside club-ready sound design—hard textures, sudden drops, and a gleaming synthetic finish. Shygirl represents a 2020s avant-pop mode where experimental production techniques are the primary expressive language, not mere decoration.

**Jockstrap — Glasgow (I Love You Jennifer B, 2022)**
Sudden beat switches and fractured textures are tied together by a clear melodic through-line, making the song feel both chaotic and precise. Jockstrap exemplify the 2020s avant-pop sweet spot: formal risk-taking that still lands as a pop payoff.
