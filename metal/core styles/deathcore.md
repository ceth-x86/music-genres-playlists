**The Red Chord — Fixation on Plastics (Fused Together in Revolving Doors, 2002)**
Often cited in conversations about deathcore's early metal/hardcore collision. The track's stop-start violence and core weighting make it a foundational reference point.

A brutal, technical early statement where breakdowns and blasts alternate in a core-forward framework. Frequently recognized as ahead-of-its-time for the style.

**Despised Icon — MVP (The Healing Process, 2005)**

Tight death-metal technique paired with core momentum; a "textbook" example of the mid-2000s Southeastern/US style.

A technically adept but breakdown-driven approach that helped define early "tight" deathcore arrangement.

A heavy precursor often discussed in deathcore genealogies; included here only because the track's core architecture strongly anticipates later deathcore norms.

A key early hybrid: death-metal intensity with a mosh calculus that forecasts the genre's mainstreaming.

Representative of the underground proto-scene where deathcore's rhythmic language is already dominant.

Captures the theatrical, blast/breakdown alternation that became a default deathcore grammar.

A brutal, math-tinged edge—but the breakdown-forward center keeps it aligned to deathcore rather than mathcore-dominant territory.
