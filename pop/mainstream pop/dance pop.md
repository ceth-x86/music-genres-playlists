**The Pointer Sisters — I'm So Excited (So Excited!, 1982)**
A textbook case of disco's afterglow turning into streamlined dance-pop—tight groove, bright synth accents, and a chorus built for shout-along release. It stayed a perennial floor-filler because the rhythmic drive never overwhelms the pop-song immediacy.

**Laura Branigan — Gloria (Branigan, 1982)**
