# Screamo

## Origins & first canon (1991–2005)

**Heroin — Head Cold (All About Heroin (7" EP), 1991)**
Early San Diego blueprint: jagged, stop‑start hardcore energy fused with the emotional extremity that later scenes would call screamo. Its tense push‑and‑pull dynamics helped define how the style separated itself from straight hardcore.

**Mohinder — To Satisfy (O Nation, You Bleed From Many Wounds, 1896 (EP), 1993)**
Mohinder pushed the style toward sharper dissonance and more violent catharsis while staying rooted in DIY hardcore. "To Satisfy" captures screamo's hallmark contrast between brittle, tumbling riffs and sudden, overwhelming climaxes.

**Julia — Song In A (Julia (7" EP), 1993)**
Julia's minimal, high‑speed writing is a key precursor to the 'skramz' vocabulary: short forms, angular melodic fragments, and raw screaming. The track is a clean early example of screamo as emotional hardcore rather than metal-derived aggression.

**Antioch Arrow — Angel's Lawn (In Love with Jetts, 1994)**
From the Gravity Records San Diego axis, Antioch Arrow injected art‑punk weirdness into hardcore velocity, a crucial ingredient in early screamo's manic feel. This song's tense staccato motion anticipates the genre's later extremity.

**Swing Kids — Disease (Swing Kids (7" EP), 1994)**
Swing Kids condense the early SoCal approach into a rush of rhythm changes and cathartic shouting, bridging hardcore and the emerging screamo sensibility. "Disease" remains influential for its dramatic dynamics without losing punk concision.

**Portraits of Past — Bang Yer Head (01010101, 1996)**
A cornerstone recording that codified screamo's contrast between brittle arpeggios and explosive screams. Its emotional directness and jagged structure became a template for countless late‑90s and early‑00s bands.

**Angel Hair — Witch Hunt Scene from Star Trek (Pregnant With the Senior Class, 1997)**
Angel Hair helped steer screamo toward more intricate, off‑kilter phrasing while keeping hardcore urgency intact. This track is often cited as a defining example of the early California strand of the genre.

**Saetia — Venus and Bacchus (Saetia (EP), 1997)**
Saetia crystallized the late‑90s New York/New Jersey version of screamo: lyrical, desperate, and dynamically volatile. "Venus and Bacchus" became a touchstone for the 'real screamo/skramz' lineage that later revivalists referenced.

**Reversal of Man — January Twenty Second (This Is Medicine, 1999)**
Reversal of Man represent screamo's harsher 'emoviolence' edge—faster, more chaotic, but still emotionally charged. This opener shows how the genre can intensify hardcore's speed without tipping fully into grindcore.

**You & I — Tell Me About Your Childhood (The Curtain Falls, 1999)**
You & I's dense guitar interplay and tightly wound crescendos helped define the Northeast's technical screamo sound. The track demonstrates how complex arrangements can still serve immediate catharsis.

**Love Lost But Not Forgotten — Loathing (Love Lost But Not Forgotten, 2000)**
A pivotal Midwest take that brought thicker textures and near‑metallic weight while keeping screamo's emotional volatility. "Loathing" is important for showing how the style can flirt with heaviness without becoming metalcore.

**Orchid — …And the Cat Turned to Smoke (Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow!, 2000)**
Orchid's ferocious minimalism and relentless momentum made them one of the most influential early‑2000s screamo bands. This track is a textbook example of high‑pressure pacing and abrupt dynamic pivots.

**Jeromes Dream — It's More Like a Message to You (Seeing Means More Than Safety, 2000)**
Jeromes Dream pushed screamo toward stark, wiry arrangements and almost anti‑rock guitar tones, emphasizing tension over riffs. The song's compressed intensity became a reference point for later 'skramz' revival bands.

**Pg.99 — In Love With An Apparition (Document #8, 2001)**
Pg.99 embodied the Virginia scene's sprawling, communal version of screamo, building chaos into cathartic peaks. This track balances raw immediacy with a sense of narrative motion that many successors emulated.

**City of Caterpillar — A Little Change Could Go a Long Ways (City of Caterpillar, 2002)**
A key document of screamo's post‑rock-informed expansion, where long-form dynamics meet hardcore urgency. The track shows how atmosphere and build‑ups can amplify, not dilute, the genre's core catharsis.

**Envy — A Will Remains in the Ashes (A Dead Sinking Story, 2003)**
Envy helped globalize the style by marrying expansive crescendos to intense hardcore foundations. This song is emblematic of their ability to make scale and emotional punch coexist.

**Circle Takes the Square — Interview at the Ruins (As the Roots Undo, 2004)**
Circle Takes the Square broadened screamo's palette with multi‑vocal arrangements and adventurous structures while keeping its raw emotional center. This track is a widely recognized peak of early‑2000s experimental screamo.

**Raein — Tigersuit (Nati per subire, 2004)**
Raein are central to the Italian scene, bringing melodic clarity and rhythmic snap that shaped Europe's 2000s wave. "Tigersuit" is frequently held up as a near-perfect balance of sweetness and abrasion.

**Gospel — Golden Dawn (The Moon Is a Dead World, 2005)**

**Funeral Diner — I Was the Sword (The Underdark, 2005)**
A defining California 2000s track: melodic and desolate, then suddenly explosive, with screaming used as an expressive peak rather than constant texture. Funeral Diner's influence is audible across later West Coast and international scenes.

**Daitro — Laisser Vivre Les Squelettes (Laisser Vivre Les Squelettes, 2005)**
