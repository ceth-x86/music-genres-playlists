## Foundations & Proto-Post-Rock (1988–1997)

**Talk Talk — The Rainbow (Spirit of Eden, 1988)**

**Slint — Good Morning, Captain (Spiderland, 1991)**
A cornerstone for post-rock's dramatic dynamics: quiet narrative tension exploding into cathartic release. The angular, spacious guitar interplay and anti-anthemic structure became foundational for later 'crescendo' writing.
