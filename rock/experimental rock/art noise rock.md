# Art Noise Rock

## Proto & No-Wave Genesis (1967–1981)

**Red Krayola — Hurricane Fighter Plane (The Parable of Arable Land, 1967)**
A proto–art-noise document: loose blues/psych forms pushed into distortion, tape haze, and collage-like abrasion. It prefigures the genre's 'art-first' attitude—noise as composition, not just volume.

**The Velvet Underground — Sister Ray (White Light/White Heat, 1968)**
A monolithic improv that treats feedback and drone as the song's main subject, not decoration. Its sheer duration and volume-normalizing repetition became a blueprint for art-noise rock's ecstatic overload.

**The Stooges — L.A. Blues (Fun House, 1970)**
A free-form closing jam where groove dissolves into feral squeal, room noise, and amplifier abuse. It's early proof that rock can reach 'noise music' intensity without leaving the band-format.

**Suicide — Ghost Rider (Suicide, 1977)**
Minimal pulse + violent timbre: drum-machine insistence under razor synth and nihilistic vocal presence. It helped define the genre's taste for confrontation and stripped, mechanical repetition.

**Pere Ubu — Final Solution (The Modern Dance, 1978)**
Jerky rhythms and alien textures turn punk energy into art-damaged futurism. The track's fractured hooks show how noise can function like melody—suggested, disrupted, and reassembled.

**Theoretical Girls — You Got Me (U.S. Millie / You Got Me (single), 1978)**
Art-school minimalism: clipped guitar figures and dry, angular rhythm that refuses rock catharsis. It's a bridge between downtown conceptualism and later 'anti-song' noise rock forms.

**Teenage Jesus and the Jerks — The Closet (No New York, 1978)**
Micro-songs reduced to pure impact: squeal, thud, shout, stop. It codifies the genre's taste for anti-virtuosity and 'noise as punctuation.'

**DNA — Blonde Redhead (No New York, 1978)**
Atonal, spidery riffs that never settle into a normal verse/chorus logic. It's foundational for art-noise's 'shards of rock' approach—fragmented but intensely physical.

**Mars — 11,000 Volts (No New York, 1978)**
Detuned guitars and stumbling rhythms create a controlled implosion. The track is archetypal no-wave: rock gestures reimagined as abstract noise sculpture.

**Public Image Ltd — Careering (Metal Box, 1979)**
Dub-weight bass and metallic guitar scrape create negative space for noise to ring out. It's a key pivot from punk to art-noise: groove as chassis, abrasion as the message.

**The Pop Group — She Is Beyond Good and Evil (Y, 1979)**
Funk tension meets jagged guitar shards, with chaos framed as political urgency. It demonstrates the 'structured turbulence' that later art-noise scenes weaponized.

**Chrome — Chromosome Damage (Half Machine Lip Moves, 1979)**
Sci‑fi paranoia rendered in degraded tones, tape smear, and damaged-riff repetition. It's influential for treating rock as a sound-design problem rather than a songcraft one.

**James Chance & The Contortions — Contort Yourself (Buy, 1979)**
No-wave's signature collision: punk aggression, funk insistence, and atonal stabbing riffs. The groove keeps moving while everything else fights it—classic art-noise dialectic.

**The Notekillers — The Zipper (The Zipper / Clockwise (single), 1980)**
A wiry, proto-no-wave guitar attack that sounds like rock being sawed apart mid-performance. Its economy and harshness are textbook art-noise—idea first, polish last.

**Lydia Lunch — Spooky (Queen of Siam, 1980)**
Noir atmospherics and dissonant accompaniment turn narrative voice into a weapon. It captures the genre's performance-art streak—seduction, menace, and sonic grit intertwined.

**Half Japanese — No Direct Line From My Brain To My Heart (Half-Gentlemen/Not Beasts, 1980)**
Outsider rock where distortion and naïve melody coexist without hierarchy. It's important for legitimizing lo‑fi noise as a sincere aesthetic, not a technical limitation.

**Glenn Branca — The Spectacular Commodity (The Ascension, 1981)**
Massed electric guitars as a minimalist orchestra—overtones, beating patterns, and physical volume. It's a cornerstone for the genre's 'art-music' aspirations inside rock instrumentation.

## No Wave Aftershocks & Art-Noise Codification (1982–1989)

**The Birthday Party — She's Hit (Junkyard, 1982)**
A violent art-punk set piece—guitar as serrated texture and rhythm as pressure. It helped normalize extremity and theatricality as core rock values in the post‑no‑wave era.

**Flipper — Sex Bomb (Generic Flipper, 1982)**
Sludge-tempo punk that drags distortion into something oppressive and hypnotic. Its anti-speed stance feeds the genre's fascination with heaviness as texture and mood.

**Swans — Stay Here (Filth, 1983)**
Relentless repetition and brutal tone make the riff feel like industrial machinery. It's central to art-noise rock's interest in endurance, reduction, and bodily impact.

**No Trend — Reality Breakdown (Too Many Humans..., 1983)**
A gleeful anti-rock provocation: riffs as parody, noise as sabotage, attitude as concept. It represents the genre's punk-adjacent critique of authenticity and taste.

**Einstürzende Neubauten — Yü-Gung (Fütter mein Ego) (Halber Mensch, 1985)**
Metal-on-metal sonics and percussive architecture push 'rock band' into sculpture-installation territory. It's definitive for treating timbre and material as the primary compositional units.

**Live Skull — Sparky (Bringing Home the Bait, 1985)**
Downtown guitar labyrinths where melody flickers inside clang and feedback. This is art-noise rock in its classic city-scene form: smart, loud, and insistently unpretty.

**Big Black — Kerosene (Atomizer, 1986)**
Drum-machine precision plus abrasive guitar scrape yields a cold, mechanized violence. It's crucial for the genre's industrial edge—noise as hard, bright, and unforgiving.

**Scratch Acid — Cannibal (Just Keep Eating, 1986)**
A nervous, stop-start groove that feels like punk filtered through performance art. The track's tension and sudden ruptures became a template for later 'art-punishing' noise bands.

**Pussy Galore — Tumbling Dice (Exile on Main St., 1986)**
Trash-the-blues deconstruction: familiar rock DNA mangled into distortion and chaos. It's influential for showing that genre-signifiers can be used purely as raw material.

Hallucinatory tape-rot textures and freaked-out dynamics turn rock into bad-trip theater. It expands art-noise beyond minimalism into surreal, collage-like psychedelia.

**Cows — Koyaanisqatsi (Taint Pluribus Taint Unum, 1987)**
A grotesque, noisy reinterpretation that treats 'cover' as sonic vandalism. The band's squall and swagger exemplify art-noise rock's love of ugliness and satire.

**Killdozer — The Puppy (Little Baby Buntin', 1987)**
Noise-rock riffing steeped in deadpan humor and abrasive tone. It's a key example of the genre's Midwest strand: heavy, cynical, and sonically blunt.

Sampling and guitar-like stabs blur rock and industrial sound design. It's pivotal for later art-noise acts that treat the studio as an instrument of abrasion.

**Ministry — Stigmata (The Land of Rape and Honey, 1988)**
A watershed industrial-rock turn where guitars become rhythmic noise blocks. It demonstrates how art-noise aesthetics can be welded to pop-tight structures without softening the impact.

**Sonic Youth — Silver Rocket (Daydream Nation, 1988)**
Alternate tunings and 'wrong' harmonies turned into anthemic propulsion. It's the genre's canonical proof that high-noise timbre and big-song ambition can coexist.

**Pain Teens — Hands In Fire (Case Histories, 1989)**
Psych-drone tension pulled through industrial abrasion and feedback wash. It's a cult cornerstone for the genre's darker, textural, almost ritualistic side.

**Godflesh — Like Rats (Streetcleaner, 1989)**
Minimal riffs and machine-like drum programming create monolithic sonic pressure. It's foundational for the heavy, industrial wing of art-noise rock—more texture than 'metal' virtuosity.

**Boredoms — Explode (Soul Discharge, 1989)**
A chaotic, hyper-physical blast where structure barely contains the noise eruption. It's essential for the Japanese avant-noise lineage that treats rock as pure energy.

## Art-Noise Underground & Hybridization (1990–1999)

**Royal Trux — Solid Gold Tooth (Twin Infinitives, 1990)**
Lo‑fi distortion and warped songcraft turn rock into a damaged mirror of itself. It's influential for the genre's 'degraded classicism'—hooks implied, then smeared into noise.

**Cop Shoot Cop — Room 429 (Consumer Revolt, 1990)**
Low-end driven attack where bass and percussion do the 'guitar' work, creating an industrial throb. It widened art-noise rock's palette toward rhythm-first, urban clang.

**The Jesus Lizard — Mouth Breather (Goat, 1991)**
Taut, lurching groove and corrosive guitar tone—primal but meticulously controlled. It's a reference point for how art-noise can stay visceral without becoming straight hardcore.

**Helmet — In the Meantime (Meantime, 1992)**
Austere, mechanical riffs and locked-in rhythm treat heaviness as geometry. The track helped establish the 'precision noise' aesthetic that later art-noise and industrial-adjacent acts refined.

**Ruins — Namahage (Burning Stone, 1992)**
Bass-and-drums maximalism: sudden cuts, odd meters, and feral momentum. It shows how art-noise rock can be virtuosic and chaotic at once, without relying on guitars.

**Zeni Geva — Desire (Desire for Agony, 1993)**
Japanese intensity where riffing becomes a texture field—grit, scrape, and forward drive. It's key for the cross-pollination between noise rock abrasion and heavy amplification culture.

**Cherubs — Stag Party (Heroin Man, 1994)**
Fuzz overload with a weirdly buoyant sense of rhythm and melody. Their sound helped bridge 90s indie circuits and the more art-damaged noise tradition.

**Unwound — Entirely Different Matters (New Plastic Ideas, 1994)**
Tense, linear build where guitars scrape at the edges of a disciplined groove. It's exemplary for art-noise rock's narrative use of dynamics—slow boil to rupture.

Interlocking guitars and explosive drumming that feels engineered to fray at the seams. It's a cornerstone for the genre's 'controlled chaos' band-chemistry.

**Brainiac — Vincent Come On Down (Bonsai Superstar, 1994)**
Synth-punk futurism: catchy motifs delivered through abrasive tone and manic energy. It anticipates 2000s art-noise's love of hooks under digital-age harshness.

**Harry Pussy — Ride My Seesaw (Ride My Seesaw, 1994)**
Two-person cyclone of free-rock noise—rhythm and texture in constant collision. It captures the genre's DIY extremity: minimal resources, maximal abrasion.

**Blonde Redhead — 11:59 (Blonde Redhead, 1995)**
Early-era jaggedness and detuned guitar interplay rooted in no-wave lineage. It's significant for carrying art-noise sensibilities into 90s indie contexts without diluting the bite.

**Oxbow — Over (Serenade in Red, 1996)**
Theatrical phrasing and dissonant heft turn noise rock into dramatic narration. It's an ideal example of art-noise as 'song'—structure intact, but warped by intensity and performance.

**Shellac — Prayer to God (Terraform, 1998)**
A bare-bones recording aesthetic where every scrape and hit is exposed. It's essential for the minimalist wing of the genre: tension, space, and 'anti-production' clarity.

**Mainliner — Mellow Out (Mellow Out, 1999)**
Acid-drenched volume where riffs liquefy into feedback and overtones. It represents the Japanese 'psychedelic-noise' edge that lives inside art-noise rock without becoming retro.

## No-Wave Revival & New Textures (2000–2009)

**Mclusky — Lightsaber Cocksucking Blues (Mclusky Do Dallas, 2002)**
Smart-aleck lyric bite wrapped in jagged riffs and clipped dynamics. It's a definitive 2000s example of how art-noise can be pop-structured yet sonically hostile.
