# Jazz Rock Prog

## First Wave: proto–Jazz Rock Prog (1968–1972)

**Blood, Sweat & Tears — Variations on a Theme by Erik Satie (Blood, Sweat & Tears, 1968)**
A baroque-to-jazz-rock suite that treats arrangement and modulation as the main event—proto-prog thinking inside horn-rock. It helped legitimize extended, quasi-classical form as part of the jazz-rock mainstream.

**Colosseum — The Valentyne Suite (Valentyne Suite, 1969)**
A defining early blueprint: a side-long, multi-movement rock suite driven by jazz harmony and extended soloing. Its shifting meters and organ/sax interplay anticipate how prog structure and fusion language would lock together.

**The Tony Williams Lifetime — Emergency (Emergency!, 1969)**
A shock of volume and improvisation that put jazz virtuosity directly into a rock power-trio frame. The fractured forms and electric timbres became a key starting point for prog-leaning fusion bands.

**The Flock — Clown (The Flock, 1969)**
One of the rawest early mergers of rock band energy with violin-and-sax jazz vocabulary. The arrangement's abrupt sectional shifts and solo features point directly toward jazz rock prog's dramatic syntax.

**Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity — Season of the Witch (Streetnoise, 1969)**
A long, improvisation-heavy reinterpretation that stretches a song into a progressive jam-suite. The organ-led drive and jazz phrasing foreshadow the UK's later jazz rock prog circuits.

**John McLaughlin — Extrapolation (Extrapolation, 1969)**
A key bridge between modern jazz harmony and the coming electric-fusion vocabulary. Even in a jazz setting, the angular themes and forward-motion comping suggest the prog-fusion language McLaughlin would soon crystallize.

**Nucleus — Elastic Rock (Elastic Rock, 1970)**
One of the earliest records to sound like "fusion" and "prog" at once: riff-based themes, open improvisation, and tight ensemble writing. The title track's jagged groove and horn voicings set a template for jazz-rock that still feels modern.

**Chicago — Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon (Chicago II, 1970)**
A mainstream band reaching for prog-scale composition: a multi-part suite stitched from contrasting themes. The horn section functions like a jazz big-band inside a rock album format, a key early crossover gesture.

**Larry Coryell — Spaces (Spaces, 1970)**
Coryell's guitar brings rock attack into a jazz ensemble context, with extended forms and virtuosic interplay. The track shows early fusion leaning toward prog-like dramatic pacing rather than head-solo-head routine.

**Ginger Baker's Air Force — Da Da Man (Ginger Baker's Air Force, 1970)**
A heavy, percussion-forward jazz-rock workout that feels closer to progressive live improvisation than to standard rock songwriting. It highlights how rhythm sections became laboratories for jazz-prog hybrid time-feels.

**Miles Davis — Right Off (A Tribute to Jack Johnson, 1971)**
A long-form, riff-centric jam that treats the studio take like a progressive rock side: build, sustain, mutate. Its relentless rock backbeat and electric guitar heroics helped define the aggressive end of jazz-rock prog.

**Traffic — The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys (The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys, 1971)**
An early example of the jazz-prog "long track" archetype: hypnotic groove, modal soloing, and gradual structural expansion. Its blend of rock songcraft and jazz phrasing influenced many UK jazz-rock outfits.

**Syrinx — Tillicum (Long Lost Relatives, 1971)**
A cult classic of early fusion-prog: sharp unison heads, elastic time-feel, and wide-open solo sections. Its crunchy electric piano and guitar tones sit closer to prog rock than to straight-ahead jazz.

**Don Ellis Orchestra — 33 222 1 222 (Tears of Joy, 1971)**
A famous odd-meter showcase where big-band writing meets electric-era propulsion. The piece demonstrates how rhythmic system-building—a prog hallmark—could be central to jazz-rock fusion.

**Mahavishnu Orchestra — Meeting of the Spirits (The Inner Mounting Flame, 1971)**
A definitive manifesto: rapid unison lines, odd-meter surges, and seismic electric-guitar intensity. Few tracks announce the core aesthetics of jazz rock prog—virtuosity plus through-composed complexity—so immediately.

**Herbie Hancock — Ostinato (Suite for Angela) (Crossings, 1972)**
A deep, cyclic ostinato piece that grows through layered polyrhythms and timbral change—very prog in its method of development. The electric textures and collective improvisation push fusion toward large-scale form.

**Santana — Song of the Wind (Caravanserai, 1972)**
Santana's most overtly prog-fusion moment: long-form composition, harmonic richness, and sustained instrumental narrative. It shows how a rock band could pivot into jazz-rock prog without losing guitar-led intensity.

**Tasavallan Presidentti — Lambertland (Lambertland, 1972)**
Scandinavian jazz-rock prog at full stride: complex ensemble themes, bluesy guitar edge, and episodic form. The track captures how European scenes fused prog ambition with jazz improvisation.

**Back Door — Slivadiv (Back Door, 1972)**
A bass-led, organ-and-drums trio sound that feels like prog's muscularity filtered through jazz language. Its tight riffs and sudden rhythmic turns became a touchstone for later instrumental prog-fusion.

## Classic Fusion-Prog Golden Age (1973–1977)

**Return to Forever — Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, 1973)**
