**Pop Will Eat Itself — Ich Bin Ein Ausländer (Dos Dedos Mis Amigos, 1994)**
Industrial-rock sampling and breakbeat propulsion foreshadowing big beat's later rock/dance hybrid. It's a useful 'proto' marker: big drums, cut-up attitude, and club-minded aggression years before the term solidified.

**Leftfield — Phat Planet (Leftism, 1995)**
