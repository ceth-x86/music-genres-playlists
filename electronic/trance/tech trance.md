# Tech Trance

## Foundations & Proto-Tech Trance (1994–2001)

**L.S.G. — Blueprint V1 (Blueprint E.P., 1994)**

**Marmion — Schöneberg (Schöneberg (Single), 1998)**
Hooj Choons-era trance with a distinctly technical groove: rolling drums, surgical synth stabs and a club-first arrangement. Its stripped propulsion is a key precursor to the 'tech' emphasis later central to tech trance.

A classic example of Oliver Lieb's techno-structured trance approach: tight rhythm logic, restrained harmony and a trancy sonic signature. It's a key bridge between late-90s techno-trance and the later, codified tech-trance sound.

**Mario Più — Communication (Somebody Answer The Phone) (Communication (Single), 1999)**

**Chris Cowie — The Hacienda (The Hacienda (Single), 2000)**
Cowie's early tech-trance approach favors rolling, minimal motifs over extended melodic storytelling, with a crisp, industrial rhythm bed. It's emblematic of the late-90s/early-00s pivot from pure trance euphoria to club-engineered drive.

**Katana — Fancy Fair (Fancy Fair (Single), 2001)**
One of the era's most recognisable 'tech' anthems: a muscular rhythm section and a hypnotic, looping hook that feels engineered for big systems. Its balance of trance tension and techno swing made it a scene staple.

**Tiësto — Lethal Industry (In My Memory, 2001)**
A mainstreaming moment where trance's drama is delivered through a heavier, more industrial groove and tightly gated synth phrasing. It's a bridge track that brought tech-trance sensibilities into stadium-sized trance culture.

**Marco V — Simulated (Simulated (Single), 2001)**
A defining Dutch tech-trance single: mechanized groove, clipped riffs and a no-nonsense arrangement aimed at DJ utility. It codified the 'stripped, driving, peak-time' language that many 2000s producers would adopt.

**Frank Biazzi — Turbulence (Turbulence (Single), 2001)**
Belgian peak-time precision: dense, percussive programming and aggressive, resonant synth design with minimal melodic padding. It's a textbook example of tech trance's 'harder synths, fewer pads' aesthetic.

**Svenson & Gielen — Twisted (Twisted (Single), 2001)**
A Dutch/Belgian floor tool built on snappy drums and a chugging bassline, keeping melodies short and functional. It captures the early 'tech-trance' idea: tension-first, with trance breakdowns used sparingly for impact.
