## Foundations and folk-horror birthline

**John Allison — The Gloucester Witch (Witches and War-Whoops: Early New England Ballads, 1962)**

**Shirley Collins — The Daemon Lover (Love, Death and the Lady, 1970)**

**Trees — The Garden of Jane Delawney (The Garden of Jane Delawney, 1970)**

A feverish prog-folk incantation that literalizes 'sorcery' through vocal drama and shifting forms. It shows how occult themes could coexist with experimental folk architecture.

**Dave & Toni Arthur — Alison Gross (Hearken to the Witches Rune, 1971)**
A quintessential 'Child Ballad' witch narrative presented with unnervingly spare traditionalism. The focus on the supernatural text (rather than arrangement flash) is a textbook occult-folk stance.

**Comus — Drip Drip (First Utterance, 1971)**

**C.O.B. — Maypole (Moyshe McStiff and the Tartan Lancers of the Sacred Heart, 1972)**
Maypole ritual is treated as strange ceremony rather than cute tradition, pushing folk into liminal territory. The performance balances communal dance-feel with a subtly uncanny undertow.

**Mellow Candle — The Poet and the Witch (Swaddling Songs, 1972)**
One of the era's clearest 'witch' songs, marrying medievalist narrative with late-psych delicacy. The track's dramatic folk storytelling became a reference point for later wyrd-folk writers.
