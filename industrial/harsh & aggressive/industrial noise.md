TENEBRIS' "Imagined Dreams" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: tape-era / signal-chain grit translated into a focused, aggressive noise statement. Placed within AAMON LEV ZOZO (a celebratory, deliberately 'dauntless' compilation), it shows industrial noise's current tendency to absorb extreme underground adjacent forms without losing its abrasive core.

**TOMMY R LEFRÈRE — Yo Body (Various Artists - AAMON LEV ZOZO, 2024)**
TOMMY R LEFRÈRE's "Yo Body" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: texture-first industrial abrasion where timbre and impact matter more than melody. The compilation's premise—friends contributing intense works for a life event—underscores how industrial noise still thrives through tight-knit networks rather than mainstream infrastructure.

**HUNGRY SOUL — Rising From The Mud (Various Artists - AAMON LEV ZOZO, 2024)**
HUNGRY SOUL's "Rising From The Mud" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: an assault of saturated electronics and physical, machine-coded sonics. Placed within AAMON LEV ZOZO (a celebratory, deliberately 'dauntless' compilation), it shows industrial noise's current tendency to absorb extreme underground adjacent forms without losing its abrasive core.

## New Forces: label document

**Jackson-Pratt — Dedicated to Lana Clarkson (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Jackson-Pratt's "Dedicated to Lana Clarkson" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: an object-focused approach to noise—sound treated as material, not songcraft. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Mayuko Hino — INORI (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Mayuko Hino's "INORI" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: mechanistic pulse and corrosive sound-design pushed to the point where rhythm becomes noise. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**Kjostad — Valve Repair (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Kjostad's "Valve Repair" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: high-density sonic pressure that foregrounds grit, clipping, and massed layers. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Mass Marriage — Cherry (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Mass Marriage's "Cherry" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: negative-space brutality: minimal gestures that land with heavy industrial weight. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**MO*TE — PRND2 (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
MO*TE's "PRND2" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: tape-era / signal-chain grit translated into a focused, aggressive noise statement. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Organ Of Corti — DEI (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Organ Of Corti's "DEI" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: texture-first industrial abrasion where timbre and impact matter more than melody. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**Kyle Flanagan — Spray Painting My Name On Another's Property (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Kyle Flanagan's "Spray Painting My Name On Another's Property" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: an assault of saturated electronics and physical, machine-coded sonics. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Rodger Stella & Scant — Alizon Device (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Rodger Stella & Scant's "Alizon Device" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: a stark, non-melodic construction built from distortion, feedback, and 'found' industrial color. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**Wince — Hair On My Brain (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Wince's "Hair On My Brain" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: an object-focused approach to noise—sound treated as material, not songcraft. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Joe Colley — Continuum 3/4 (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Joe Colley's "Continuum 3/4" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: mechanistic pulse and corrosive sound-design pushed to the point where rhythm becomes noise. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**Jeph Jerman — Diviner (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Jeph Jerman's "Diviner" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: high-density sonic pressure that foregrounds grit, clipping, and massed layers. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.

**Form Hunter — Pulp (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Form Hunter's "Pulp" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: negative-space brutality: minimal gestures that land with heavy industrial weight. This label-snapshot matters historically: it's a document of a scene sustained by small imprints and dedicated listeners, not commercial cycles.

**Matriarch — Paper Dolls (Vigilant New Forces, 2025)**
Matriarch's "Paper Dolls" is a textbook example of Industrial Noise: tape-era / signal-chain grit translated into a focused, aggressive noise statement. On New Forces' 15-year celebration compilation, it frames industrial noise alongside experimental sound practice—proof the genre's borders remain porous but its timbral priorities stay consistent.
