## Pioneers & Art‑School Elevation (1967–1975)

**The Velvet Underground — Heroin (The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967)**
A downtown-art take on rock: droning harmony, stark narrative realism, and deliberate abrasion. It set a precedent for art rock treating sound and subject matter as conceptual material.

**Procol Harum — A Whiter Shade of Pale (Procol Harum, 1967)**
Baroque organ lines and oblique lyricism brought 'high-art' sonorities into the rock single format. Its classical-leaning grandeur helped legitimize art rock's taste for elevated references.

A hooky chapter in a rock opera that made narrative and character central to the listening experience. It shows art rock's early pivot toward albums as authored, thematic works.

**The Kinks — Shangri-La (Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), 1969)**
Social satire and conceptual songwriting turn everyday domestic fantasy into a miniature drama. The track exemplifies art rock's art-school impulse to critique culture through pop form.

**David Bowie — Life on Mars? (Hunky Dory, 1971)**
A cinematic, hyper-detailed song-world where harmony, arrangement, and persona are inseparable. It's a cornerstone of art rock theatricality without tipping into glam-boogie or prog-suite territory.

**Lou Reed — Walk on the Wild Side (Transformer, 1972)**
Literary character sketches and cool minimalism reframe rock as urban reportage. Its detached poise became a model for art rock's 'observational' songwriting and stylized narration.

**Roxy Music — In Every Dream Home a Heartache (For Your Pleasure, 1973)**
Decadent imagery, modernist textures, and a slow-burn structure treat desire as performance art. Few tracks capture art rock's fusion of art-school irony and sensual surface so precisely.

**Brian Eno — Baby's on Fire (Here Come the Warm Jets, 1974)**
A glam-adjacent guitar freakout filtered through conceptual production and art-pop wit. Eno's 'studio-as-composition' approach is foundational to later experimental-minded art rock.

**Sparks — This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us (Kimono My House, 1974)**

A landmark in studio illusionism: layered vocal 'pads' and production as emotional narrative. Its engineering-driven drama embodies art rock's shift from band performance to crafted sonic architecture.

**Patti Smith — Gloria (Horses, 1975)**
Poetry-meets-garage: sacred/profane reframing and art-literary stance over raw rock propulsion. It's pivotal for the art-punk lineage that grew directly out of art rock attitudes.

**Bryan Ferry — A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall (These Foolish Things, 1973)**
A pop-art cover-as-recontextualization that treats repertoire like gallery-ready material. Ferry's curated persona and stylized delivery helped codify art rock as 'presentation' as much as sound.

**John Cale — Paris 1919 (Paris 1919, 1973)**
Chamber-rock elegance and ambiguous storytelling merge avant sensibility with melodic clarity. It's a key example of art rock balancing 'high' arrangement with songcraft.

**Steely Dan — Rikki Don't Lose That Number (Pretzel Logic, 1974)**
