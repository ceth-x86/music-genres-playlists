# Electro Industrial

## Origins & Early Canon (1985–1991)

**Skinny Puppy — Assimilate (Bites, 1985)**
A foundational electro‑industrial anthem: sample-driven groove, corrosive vocal processing, and sound-design-as-composition that became the genre's calling card. Its mix of dance propulsion and psychological horror set the blueprint for the rivethead era.

**Vomito Negro — Dare (Dare, 1985)**
A genre-faithful cut where sequencing, sampling, and abrasive texture take precedence over rock instrumentation. It's historically valuable as part of the style's club-facing evolution and the rivethead/industrial dance continuum.

**A Split Second — Flesh (Flesh, 1986)**

**Pankow — Follow Me in Suicide (Gisela, 1989)**
European electro‑industrial with a transgressive, theatrical streak—provocative vocals over harsh electronics and cutting rhythmic edits. It captures the genre's tradition of using shock and satire as part of its sonic aggression.

**Cyberaktif — Nothing Stays (Tenebrae Vision, 1990)**
A supergroup snapshot that bridges late‑80s industrial experimentation and the early‑90s electro‑industrial mainstream—layered samplers, hard drum programming, and bleak melodicism. Historically, it's important as a proof-of-concept that the sound could be both experimental and dancefloor-functional.

**Leæther Strip — Adrenalin Rush (Solitary Confinement, 1992)**
