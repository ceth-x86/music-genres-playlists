# Krautrock

## Foundations (1969–1971)

**Amon Düül — Der Garten Sandosa im Morgentau (Psychedelic Underground, 1969)**
A raw commune-document that captures Krautrock before it hardened into signatures: collective trance, loose-form escalation, and anti-"song" structure. Its importance is how it frames Kraut as process—a band becoming a social organism in real time.

**Orange Peel — We Still Try to Change (Orange Peel, 1969)**
A transitional German underground cut where psychedelic rock starts to stretch into the longer-form, less Anglo-blues logic associated with early Kraut scenes. It's valuable as a "hinge" document: the moment German bands begin sounding like themselves.

**Xhol Caravan — All Green (Electrip, 1969)**
An early template for the Kraut habit of extended groove-as-landscape, balancing rock propulsion with exploratory timbral drift. The track's significance lies in its scene-setting: improvisation that feels architectural rather than soloistic.

**Amon Düül II — Archangel Thunderbird (Yeti, 1970)**
Amon Düül II's knack for ritualistic momentum and abrupt sectional pivots makes this a canonical early statement of German progressive psychedelia becoming Krautrock. It's influential for marrying mythic intensity with a band-driven, non-virtuosic collective push.

**Embryo — You Don't Know What's Happening (Opal, 1970)**
A classic example of early Kraut's "open corridor" arranging: the groove is the vehicle, the route is discovered on the move. It matters because it shows how German bands built form out of duration, not hooks.

**Floh de Cologne — Fließbandbaby (Fließbandbabys Beat-Show, 1970)**
Krautrock's political/agitational edge is central here: satire and concept framing fused to rough, stage-to-studio energy. It's important for showing that Kraut wasn't only sonic futurism—it was also countercultural critique in German-specific terms.

**Gomorrha — Trauma (Trauma, 1970)**
A heavy, mind-expanding early cut where repetition and density create the "head-music" atmosphere later associated with Kraut trance. Its value is how it foregrounds texture and churn over conventional chorus-based drama.

**Guru Guru — Der LSD-Marsch (UFO, 1970)**
A foundational "acid-kraut" blast: manic momentum, warped humor, and improvisational risk-taking under rock volume. It's historically crucial as one of the clearest early statements that German underground rock could be experimental, physical, and unhinged at once.

**Kin Ping Meh — Fairy Tales (Kin Ping Meh, 1970)**
A German heavy-psych/proto-prog cut that earns its Krautrock place through its emphasis on long-form development over riff showmanship. It helps map how the broader West German scene fed the Kraut ecosystem even when the surface sound leaned rockier.

**Kluster — Klopfzeichen (Klopfzeichen, 1970)**
A key early "studio-as-ritual" document: percussion, noise, and repetition treated as composition rather than accompaniment. Its importance is as a precursor to industrial, ambient, and experimental rock—via unmistakably Kraut methods of reduction and focus.

**Kraftwerk — Ruckzuck (Kraftwerk, 1970)**
Proto-motorik in embryo: forward motion, minimal harmonic insistence, and a sense of mechanized glide before Kraftwerk fully crystallized their later identity. It's essential because it captures the band at the exact point where Krautrock becomes machine-aesthetic.

**Organisation — Tone Float (Tone Float, 1970)**
Organisation (proto-Kraftwerk) offers a sprawling, exploratory bridge from late-60s psych to the motoric, systems-based thinking Kraut would mainstream. It's important less for polish than for the blueprint: long arcs built from small, repeating cells.

**Rufus Zuphall — Weiß der Teufel (Weiß der Teufel..., 1970)**
A German underground prog-rock track that leans Kraut through its emphasis on movement rather than symphonic ornament. It's a useful marker of how Kraut aesthetics spread: not a single sound, but a shared commitment to extended, band-driven form.

**Sweet Smoke — Baby Night (Just a Poke, 1970)**
A marathon jam that exemplifies the Kraut-era appetite for time-sculpture—music that changes by accretion rather than by songwriting turns. It's influential as a cult classic showing how trance duration became a scene-wide value.

**A.R. & Machines — Station 1: Globus (Die Grüne Reise, 1971)**
A landmark for looped/processed guitar as a Krautrock timbre—hypnotic, cyclical, and studio-built. Its significance is how it anticipates later ambient-rock and electronic minimalism using explicitly rock-era tools and thinking.

**Annexus Quam — Osmose (Osmose, 1971)**
A strong example of the "cosmic psych" end of early Kraut: long-breath pacing, spaciousness, and an anti-pop refusal to resolve quickly. It matters as part of the era's ecosystem where improvisation becomes world-building.

**Brainticket — Brainticket, Pt. 1 (Cottonwoodhill, 1971)**
A hallucinatory deep cut that foregrounds Kraut's fascination with altered states and studio manipulation. Its importance is the way it turns psychedelic excess into a system of repetition, not merely a jam.

**Bröselmaschine — Schmetterling (Bröselmaschine, 1971)**
A German underground track that threads acid-folk color into a broader Kraut sensibility: drift, repetition, and a non-commercial relationship to structure. It's valuable for showing how Krautrock's "German counterculture" identity included softer timbral palettes too.

**Can — Halleluhwah (Tago Mago, 1971)**
One of the most defining motorik performances ever recorded: the groove becomes a living machine that generates form from within. Historically, it's central because it codifies Krautrock's core paradox—maximum forward drive with minimal harmonic change.

**Deuter — Babylon (D, 1971)**
A kosmische-leaning track that demonstrates how Krautrock's experimental wing could prioritize atmosphere while still thinking in processual terms. It's important as an early step toward ambient/electronic offshoots while retaining Kraut's trance logic.

**Epitaph — Losing Myself (Epitaph, 1971)**
A German rock track whose Kraut value is its refusal of neat pop structure in favor of extended tension and release. It helps document the period when German bands collectively rejected Anglo templates and pursued duration as identity.

**Eulenspygel — Eulenspygel (Eulenspygel, 1971)**
A scene-document that reflects the early-70s German underground as a network rather than a single sound: exploratory pacing, psychedelic expansion, and an outsider relationship to "singles." It's included for representing Krautrock's broader sociomusical field.

**Frumpy — How the Gypsy Was Born (Frumpy 2, 1971)**
A heavy, extended piece that earns its place through era-typical length, risk, and band-as-engine momentum rather than ornate prog symphonics. It's significant as evidence of how German progressive rock often intersected with Kraut values of sprawl and intensity.

**Gila — Kommunikation (Free Electric Sound, 1971)**
A darkly hypnotic cut where repetition and density create a slow-moving psychedelic machine. It's important because it captures the "heavy trance" branch of Kraut—less futurist sheen, more communal ritual.

**Out of Focus — See How a White Negro Flies (Wake Up!, 1971)**
A long-form suite that shows Krautrock's appetite for fearless structure: sections evolve by accumulation rather than chorus logic. It's historically valuable as an example of German bands pushing the album-era idea of journey to extremes.

**Popol Vuh — In den Gärten Pharaos (In den Gärten Pharaos, 1971)**
A foundational spiritual-kosmische statement: sustained tones and slowly shifting timbres that feel like ritual space. It matters because it shows Krautrock's experimental edge could be mystical and minimal, not only motorik and loud.

**Witthüser & Westrupp — Der Jesuspilz (Trips und Träume, 1971)**
A countercultural German-language artifact that reflects Krautrock's wider milieu—commune politics, psychedelia, and anti-mainstream storytelling. It's included as a scene-anchoring example of how the movement's ethos extended beyond "rock band" formats.

## Golden Age (1972–1973)

**Agitation Free — Sahara City (Malesch, 1972)**
A definitive travel-trance piece where rhythm and texture build a sense of motion without conventional rock climaxing. Its importance lies in how it demonstrates Krautrock's ability to evoke geography and ritual through repetition.

**Ash Ra Tempel — Suche & Liebe (Schwingungen, 1972)**
A peak-era cosmic jam: patient groove, expansive guitar, and a communal sense of lift. It's crucial for showing the "kosmische rock" branch at full strength—space without space-rock cliché.

**Birth Control — Gamma Ray (Hoodoo Man, 1972)**
A German heavy-progressive epic that aligns with Kraut through its extended propulsion and refusal to tidy itself into radio form. It's included because it exemplifies how the era's best long tracks often function as single-piece worlds.

**Dom — Edge of Time (Edge of Time, 1972)**
A strong example of Krautrock's "slow burn" approach: groove and atmosphere are the composition, not the backdrop. Historically, it's important as a cult benchmark for hypnotic, minimal-development psychedelia.

**Ibliss — Margah (Supernova, 1972)**
Tribalized rhythm, fuzz, and repetition combine into a distinctly Kraut trance rather than blues-rock jamming. It matters because it highlights the genre's ritual-percussion instincts—rock as a moving drum-circle machine.

**Jane — Daytime (Together, 1972)**
A classic German long-track that favors forward movement and section-building over ornate prog embellishment. It's included as a representative of the era's "road music" aesthetic: drive, expand, transform.

**Mythos — Encyclopedia Terrae (Mythos, 1972)**
Mythos embodies the kosmische side of Krautrock: expansive pacing, shimmering timbres, and patient layering. The track's importance is its scene-defining blend of rock instrumentation and cosmic atmosphere.

**Neu! — Hallogallo (Neu!, 1972)**
The motorik Rosetta stone: steady pulse, minimal harmonic motion, maximum forward momentum. It's historically essential because it becomes the reference point for decades of "motorik revival" across rock, electronic, and indie contexts.

**Thirsty Moon — Yellow Sunshine (Thirsty Moon, 1972)**
A cult favorite that captures Krautrock's heavy psychedelic propulsion without drifting into symphonic prog gestures. It matters for its balance of groove and abandon—tight enough to trance, wild enough to surprise.

**Tritonus — Between the Universes (Between the Universes, 1972)**
A German underground progressive track that earns its Krautrock placement through long-form motion and exploratory pacing rather than grandiose arrangement. It's representative of how the German scene often pursued expansion over decoration.

**Wallenstein — Mother Universe (Mother Universe, 1972)**
A hallmark of German heavy psych/prog that leans Kraut in its duration, intensity, and incremental building. It's included as a period-defining example of how "big" tracks could remain band-driven and trance-oriented.

**Between — And the Waters Opened (And the Waters Opened, 1973)**
A deep-cut illustration of Krautrock's fascination with slow transformation: themes emerge as environments rather than melodies. Its value lies in how it frames Kraut as sonic architecture.

**Faust — Krautrock (Faust IV, 1973)**
A self-aware, definitive statement: motorik thrust plus studio cleverness, turning the genre's reputation into a working method. Historically, it's crucial for demonstrating how repetition can be both rocking and conceptual.

**Kollektiv — Gage (Kollektiv, 1973)**
A strong example of ensemble-based long-form construction: the band builds a living structure from layered parts rather than spotlighting chops. It's included because it captures the collective, process-first ethic at the heart of Krautrock.

**Sergius Golowin — Lord Krishna von Goloka (Lord Krishna von Goloka, 1973)**
A kosmische scene artifact where spoken mysticism and drifting grooves merge into a uniquely German psychedelic ritual. It matters historically because it shows the Kraut ecosystem's porous border between rock band and esoteric studio project.

**The Cosmic Jokers — Galactic Joke (Cosmic Jokers, 1973)**
A classic cosmic collective track built around sustained motion and studio haze, embodying the "communal trance" aesthetic of the era. It's influential as a benchmark for how Krautrock could feel endless without becoming static.

**Walter Wegmüller — Der Wagen (Tarot, 1973)**
A foundational kosmische piece where repetition and atmosphere function as narrative—music that "moves" by slow reframing. It's important because it documents the scene's shift toward mythic-concept albums made from process and texture.

**Yatha Sidhra — Laughter (A Meditation Mass, 1973)**
A cult classic that fuses heavy psychedelia with hypnotic repetition, favoring trance over theatrical prog. Its significance lies in how it distills Krautrock's "inner journey" ethos into a single, immersive performance.

## Late Kraut & Studio Modernism (1977–1981)

**Cluster & Eno — Ho Renomo (Cluster & Eno, 1977)**
A distilled late-70s statement where repetition and small timbral shifts become the drama. It's important because it captures Krautrock's transition into minimal studio composition with rock-era discipline.

**Michael Rother — Flammende Herzen (Flammende Herzen, 1977)**
Rother turns motorik heritage into melodic propulsion—forward motion made emotional rather than purely mechanical. It's historically key as a bridge from early-70s band Kraut to late-70s auteur "motorik pop".

**Conrad Schnitzler — Ballet Statique (Ballet Statique, 1978)**
A late Kraut artifact where electronics, pulse, and montage feel like architectural design rather than "songs." Its significance is Schnitzler's role in pushing Krautrock's experimental logic toward proto-industrial and synth minimalism.

**Eno, Moebius, Roedelius — Foreign Affairs (After the Heat, 1978)**
A textbook example of how Krautrock's methods—loops, restraint, process—could generate emotionally vivid minimal music. It matters because it shows the genre's studio aesthetics becoming a portable international language.

**Klaus Dinger — Punk Rock (Né Né, 1978)**
Dinger refracts motorik into a jagged, confrontational late-70s frame, foreshadowing post-punk's mechanical drive. It's important as evidence that Krautrock didn't end—it mutated into new rhythmic attitudes.

**Michael Hoenig — Departure from the Northern Wasteland (Departure from the Northern Wasteland, 1978)**
A long-form studio journey where structure emerges from gradual evolution and sustained pulse. It's included because it demonstrates Krautrock's late-era contribution to systemic electronic composition rooted in trance continuity.

**Roedelius — Durch die Wüste (Durch die Wüste, 1978)**
Roedelius exemplifies the "human" side of Kraut minimalism: small melodic gestures floating in a process-driven frame. The track matters for showing how Krautrock's experimental impulse could be intimate and painterly, not only propulsive.

**Wolfgang Riechmann — Wunderbar (Wunderbar, 1978)**
A cult classic of late-70s synth modernism with a clear Kraut lineage in its repetition and texture-first focus. It's historically valuable as a snapshot of the scene's shift toward solo studio futurism.

**Christopher Franke — Pacific Coast Highway (Pacific Coast Highway, 1979)**
Franke carries the Kraut ethos of longform momentum into sleek, composed electronics. It's significant as a document of how motorik/process thinking influenced late-70s instrumental synth music beyond band formats.

**Holger Czukay — Persian Love (Movies, 1979)**
Czukay's collage instincts—sampling, montage, studio play—are pure Kraut method applied to pop-cultural debris. It's important because it shows the movement's experimental DNA thriving in post-band, studio-art contexts.

**Robert Schroeder — Harmonic Ascendant (Harmonic Ascendant, 1979)**
A sequencer-based epic that embodies Krautrock's legacy of trance development and gradual transformation. Its importance is in consolidating the "system music" approach that Kraut helped legitimize: structure by modulation.

**Conny Plank — Plankton (Plankton, 1980)**
A rare producer-as-artist statement from one of Krautrock's central studio minds, emphasizing texture, rhythm, and sonic personality. It matters because it spotlights the genre's often hidden backbone: production as composition.

**E.M.A.K. — Ursula (E.M.A.K., 1980)**
A late Kraut example of hybridized minimal groove and electronic timbre, aligned with the movement's process-first aesthetics. It's included because it captures the scene's drift toward post-rock electronics without abandoning trance logic.

**Harald Grosskopf — Emphasis (Synthesist, 1980)**
A quintessential pulse piece: repetition becomes the narrative, with timbre acting as the evolving "plot." It's historically notable as a bridge from Krautrock's motorik engine to later electronic dance and ambient structures.

**Moebius & Plank — Rastakraut Pasta (Rastakraut Pasta, 1980)**
A late-era studio oddity where groove, texture, and playful minimalism collide—very Kraut in its refusal of standard rock development. It's important as an example of how Krautrock's experimental spirit survived as idiosyncratic studio craft.

**Rolf Trostel — Two Faces (Two Faces, 1980)**
A representative late-70s/early-80s electronic-rock crossover where form is produced by repetition and incremental change. It's included as part of the "afterglow" period when Kraut methods continued shaping instrumental futurism.

## Post-Kraut & Neo-Kraut Seeds (1982–2000)

**Asmus Tietchens — Spät (Spät, 1982)**
Tietchens extends Krautrock's reductionist logic into rigorous electronic minimalism: structure emerges from restraint. It's important as a post-Kraut example of the movement's core method—process over song—surviving into the 80s.

**Dieter Moebius — Kleine Welten (Kleine Welten, 1982)**
A solo statement that keeps the Cluster lineage alive through texture-led repetition and understated momentum. It matters for documenting the "micro-gesture" tradition: Krautrock's experimental ethos translated into personal-scale studio composition.

**Manuel Göttsching — E2-E4 (E2-E4, 1984)**
A monumental system-piece built from cycling patterns and subtle shifts, often heard as a missing link between Kraut process music and later electronic forms. It's included because its DNA is unmistakably Kraut: hypnosis, duration, and incremental transformation.

**The Fall — I Am Damo Suzuki (This Nation's Saving Grace, 1985)**
A direct homage that proves how deeply Krautrock's motorik and repetition had permeated post-punk methodology. It's important as a cultural marker: the genre becomes a repeatable technique for new scenes, not just a historical moment.

**Stereolab — Jenny Ondioline (Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements, 1993)**
One of the defining neo-kraut tracks: motorik drive and repetitive guitar figure treated as an engine for duration and texture. It matters because it helped reintroduce Krautrock's core rhythmic idea to 90s alternative audiences as a living form.

**Tortoise — Djed (Millions Now Living Will Never Die, 1996)**
A post-rock epic whose Krautrock inheritance is structural: longform development through repetition, timbral evolution, and groove as architecture. It's significant for showing how Kraut techniques could power a new "instrumental rock" language in the 90s.

**Primal Scream — Kowalski (Vanishing Point, 1997)**
A motorik-informed rocker that channels the forward-drive discipline of Neu!-era trance into a late-90s production frame. It's included because the track uses Krautrock's relentless continuity as the primary dramatic device.

**To Rococo Rot — Telema (The Amateur View, 1999)**
A clear German neo-kraut statement: minimal groove, clean timbres, and process-based arrangement rather than song fireworks. It matters as a key point where Krautrock's method becomes compatible with late-90s post-rock/electronic hybridity.

**Trans Am — Red Line (Red Line, 2000)**
A late-90s/early-00s motorik-driven track where repetition and forward motion are the compositional core. It's included as a marker of how Krautrock's engine migrated into modern rock contexts while staying rhythm-first and system-minded.

## Global Motorik Revival (2001–2020s)

**Oneida — Each One Teach One (Each One Teach One, 2002)**
A modern trance-rock monolith built on repetition, gradual intensification, and ensemble lock—classic Kraut mechanics in a new century. It's important as proof that the genre's core idea is a performance technology that still generates new forms.

**Fujiya & Miyagi — Ankle Injuries (Transparent Things, 2006)**
A crisp, groove-centric neo-kraut single where motorik discipline shapes the entire arrangement. Its significance is how it translates Krautrock's forward-drive minimalism into modern, hook-aware precision without losing the trance effect.

**LCD Soundsystem — All My Friends (Sound of Silver, 2007)**
A contemporary classic built on relentless pulse and incremental layering—Krautrock's motorik logic repurposed for emotional, communal crescendo. It's included because the track's primary dramatic arc is repetition plus accumulation, the genre's central strategy.

**Drums Off Chaos — Drums Off Chaos (Drums Off Chaos, 2009)**
A late-era motorik laboratory: rhythm as system, variation as microscopic shift, tension as endurance. It's significant for reconnecting Krautrock directly to one of its defining figures (the Can drum lineage) while sounding entirely modern.

**The Horrors — Sea Within a Sea (Primary Colours, 2009)**
A neo-kraut anthem built around driving repetition and wide stereo space, using motorik momentum as the song's spine. It's included because Krautrock isn't an accent here—it's the structural engine that carries the whole piece.

**Suuns — 2020 (Zeroes QC, 2010)**
A minimalist, pulse-forward track where repetition and texture substitution generate form. It's important as a modern example of Krautrock's "cold drive" translated into contemporary production and timbre.

**Kreidler — New Earth (Tank, 2011)**
A German continuation of the tradition: disciplined groove, motorik implication, and compositional restraint. It matters because it shows how Krautrock survives best not as nostalgia but as method—tight systems, subtle change.

**Moon Duo — Sleepwalker (Mazes, 2011)**
A modern motorik-psych cut where the drum pulse and cycling guitar figure create a trance platform for gradual expansion. It's included because the track's dominant identity is Kraut-style forward motion, not psychedelic ornament.

**BEAK> — Wulfstan II (>>, 2012)**
A contemporary motorik benchmark: minimal riffs, locked rhythm, and slow-burning development that privileges groove over chord change. It's significant for proving how well Krautrock's core syntax adapts to 21st-century rock sonics.

**Camera — Radiate! (Radiate!, 2012)**
A direct Berlin neo-kraut statement: motorik propulsion as the main compositional fact, with variation achieved through layering and timbral shifts. It's important because it reconnects Krautrock to a scene practice—bands actively rebuilding the form in its historical homeland.

**TOY — Kopter (TOY, 2012)**
A modern riff-trance track where relentless drive and incremental build are more important than chorus payoff. It's included as a clear example of Krautrock's rhythmic DNA powering contemporary psych-rock without slipping into space-rock theatrics.

**Föllakzoid — 9 (II, 2013)**
A global motorik exemplar: repetition so strict it becomes meditative, with drama created by tiny shifts in intensity and texture. It's significant as part of the 2010s wave that treated Krautrock as minimalist rock practice, not retro styling.

**Nisennenmondai — N (N, 2013)**
A trance-machine performance where the groove is both the structure and the narrative, built with extreme discipline. It's important because it demonstrates Krautrock's core engine thriving in a very different scene and instrumentation economy.

**Klaus Johann Grobe — Discogedanken (Im Sinne der Zeit, 2014)**
A sleek "krautpop" update: motorik-informed drive and repetition used to create buoyant forward motion. It's included because it shows the genre's methods can yield lightness without losing their trance authority.

**Møtrik — Circuit Breaker (Møtrik, 2014)**
A modern motorik track that treats rhythm as a stable platform for slow harmonic/timbral evolution. It's significant for representing how the Kraut idea has become an international idiom for precision trance-rock.

**Cavern of Anti-Matter — tardis cymbals (Void Beats / Invocation Trex, 2016)**
A tightly conceptual neo-kraut piece built from pulse, repetition, and studio micro-variation. It matters because it foregrounds the genre's most durable trait: form as the audible result of a system running.

**Minami Deutsch — Tunnel (Tunnel / New Pastoral Life, 2016)**
A standout modern motorik track where forward drive and cyclical patterning dominate the musical identity. It's important as part of the global revival that treats Krautrock as discipline and endurance, not simply "German flavor."
