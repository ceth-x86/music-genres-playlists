# Psychodelic Dark Folk

## 1) Proto-canon: Acid-Folk & Folk-Horror Seeds (1964–1974)

**Shirley Collins & Davy Graham — Nottamun Town (Folk Roots, New Routes, 1964)**
An early blueprint for the "uncanny folk" feeling—traditional material made strange through atmosphere and phrasing. It prefigures the folk-horror logic later central to psychedelic dark folk.

**Dr. Strangely Strange — Strangely Strange But Oddly Normal (Kip of the Serenes, 1969)**
A cult psych-folk artifact where songcraft is bent toward surreal, off-kilter sensibility. It points to the genre's key trick: familiar folk language made subtly disorienting.

**Fairport Convention — A Sailor's Life (Unhalfbricking, 1969)**
A dark narrative ballad expanded into hypnotic, psychedelic time—one of the clearest bridges between folk storytelling and psychedelic structure. Its scale and drift anticipate later "trance-folk" approaches.

**Forest — Graveyard (Forest, 1969)**
Pastoral folk-rock re-tilted toward morbidity—proof that darkness can be embedded in rural imagery without abandoning folk roots. A proto–folk-horror move: landscape as omen.

**Pearls Before Swine — The Jeweler (The Use of Ashes, 1970)**
A hushed, fatalistic acid-folk meditation where darkness is psychological rather than theatrical. Its inward dread and fragile beauty became a template for later sepulchral psych-folk.

**Simon Finn — Jerusalem (Pass the Distance, 1970)**
Outsider intensity with a biblical/visionary charge, showing how "dark" can be spiritual and unsettling at once. A stark example of folk form pulling toward hallucinatory gravity.

**Trader Horne — Morning Way (Morning Way, 1970)**
Ceremonial, liminal psych-folk—more threshold-ritual than pop song. It models the genre's ability to feel "ancient" while still structurally psychedelic.

**Comus — Drip Drip (First Utterance, 1971)**
One of the genre's clearest apex texts: folk instrumentation and ballad logic turned into a violent pastoral nightmare. It's the canonical proof that psychedelia can be horror by *form*, not effects.

**Extradition — Dear One (Hush, 1971)**
A strong example of acid-folk darkness outside the UK core myth: intimate folk writing with a heavy, shadowed emotional temperature. It underscores the genre's portability beyond one scene.

**Fresh Maggots — Rosemary Hill (Fresh Maggots, 1971)**
A cult underground psych-folk piece where reverie carries a faint threat. It captures the genre's characteristic "beautiful-but-wrong" pastoral aura.

**Jan Dukes de Grey — Mice and Rats in the Loft (Mice and Rats in the Loft, 1971)**
A sprawling, grotesque narrative suite—folk storytelling expanded into psychedelic development. It demonstrates the genre's taste for slow revelation and unsettling imagery.

**Shelagh McDonald — Dowie Dens of Yarrow (Stargazer, 1971)**
A murder-ballad tradition reframed as haunted, psychedelic melancholy rather than straightforward revivalism. Darkness arrives through story plus atmosphere—core psychedelic dark folk logic.

**Spring — Grail (Spring, 1971)**
War-haunted, ominous, and expansive—folk-related narrative weight pushed into shadowed psych-rock drama. It's a boundary-case that still fits because the darkness and psychedelic pacing dominate.

**C.O.B. — Mayday (Moyshe McStiff and the Tartan Lancers of the Sacred Heart, 1972)**
Acid-folk as slow emergency flare: tension, release, and dread used as compositional tools. A key example of psychedelic build supporting folk-rooted intensity.

**Mark Fry — The Witch (Dreaming with Alice, 1972)**
A textbook "haunted folk psych" vignette: folk songcraft with witchcraft imagery and dreamlike framing. It's a clean early instance of folk-horror symbolism inside psychedelic folk language.

## 2) Contemporary Cornerstones & Standalone Statements (2006–2022)

**Espers — Dead Queen (Espers II, 2006)**
A modern psych-folk landmark with unmistakably funereal poise—darkness as atmosphere, not costume. It helped define how 2000s revivalism could sound both traditional and hallucinatory.

**Ashley Remblum — Not Ready (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
A scene-document cut: its inclusion marks it as part of the curated modern acid-folk / folk-horror continuum. It represents the genre's DIY afterlife—dark folk form shaded by psychedelic mood.

**The Heartwood Institute — Goacher (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Another sampler-defined key: positioned alongside explicitly acid-folk / folk-horror material, it reads as part of the modern "wyrd folk" map. It exemplifies how psychedelic dark folk circulates via compilations as much as albums.

**theblackchurch — Ekstasis (Ekstasis, 2016)**
Explicitly tagged as psychedelic dark folk, it foregrounds trance and devotional gloom as the main event. It shows the genre's contemporary tilt toward immersive, ritual-adjacent psychedelia without becoming "Ritual Folk."

**The Owl Service — Dives & Lazarus (Rise Up Rise Up, 2021)**
A folk-horror flagship act: traditional/folk material recontextualized through eerie framing and modern psych sensibility. It's central to the "haunted England" wing of psychedelic dark folk.

**Burd Ellen — The Lovers (A Tarot Of The Green Wood, 2022)**
Tarot symbolism used as structural mythology rather than decoration—dark folk narrative thinking in conceptual form. It's a modern exemplar of psychedelic dark folk as *ritualized storytelling* rather than genre pastiche.

**Edith A.U.F.N — Gwen (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**

**The Hare And The Moon — Cruel Henry (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
A key node in the UK folk-horror constellation: traditional-ballad logic reframed as uncanny psych-folk. Its canonical status comes from how often the scene points back to it.

**Joonatan Elokuu & Aura Shining Green — Rivers of Darkness, Seas of Light (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Scope and symbolism signal the long-form, drifting wing of the genre. It exemplifies how psychedelic dark folk can feel like a passage or rite rather than a "song."

**James McKeown — Hemlock (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Poison-as-folklore motif—classic dark folk semiotics delivered in psych-folk framing. It's a clean example of how darkness can be encoded in archetype and plant-myth.

**Alice Artaud — La Mort de la Rose (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Death imagery filtered through tenderness—one of the genre's defining contradictions. Psychedelia here functions as emotional deepening rather than spectacle.

**Alex Monk — Pluckley Follies (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
A direct nod to haunted-geography folklore—placing folk-horror "somewhere" rather than "sometime." It's exemplary of the genre's map-of-ghosts sensibility.

**Katje Janisch — The Queen of Swords (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Tarot again, but sharpened into a darker archetype: the genre's symbolic method in miniature. It represents how contemporary psychedelic dark folk builds worlds through emblematic figures.

**The Left Outsides — You Told Your Secrets to the Sea (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Confession plus elemental vastness—intimate darkness projected onto landscape. This is a hallmark psychedelic dark folk move: personal dread externalized into nature-myth.

**Mr.Pine — Lancet (The Active Listener's Acid Folk Sampler Volume Two, 2015)**
Bodily/medical suggestion lends cold menace without needing grand theatrics. It exemplifies how the genre can feel dangerous through implication and restraint.

**Hanford Reach — Unfold (The Active Listener Sampler 2020, 2020)**
"Unfolding" is practically a compositional instruction for the genre. It aligns with psychedelic dark folk's slow-revelation pacing and atmospheric priority.

**The Love Explosion — Novocastria (The Active Listener Sampler 2020, 2020)**
Place-name mythmaking—a scene hallmark where geography becomes occult-signifier. Psychedelia here is the lens that makes the local feel uncanny.

Elemental cycles are a natural trance engine for psychedelic dark folk. "Tides" also fits the genre's love of slow, inescapable motion.

**The Danbury Lie — Red Canyon (The Active Listener Sampler 2020, 2020)**

A reminder that psychedelic dark folk can be urban as well as pastoral. Darkness here reads as memory/possession of place rather than countryside myth alone.

**Sleepyard — Falling in Love (The Active Listener Sampler 2020, 2020)**
Romantic subject matter doesn't force it into Romantic/Poetic Folk if the emotional temperature stays shadowed. It exemplifies dark folk intimacy filtered through psychedelic softness.

**The Engine Room — The Girl With The Laughing Voice Parts 1 & 2 (The Active Listener Sampler 2020, 2020)**

### 4a) WEIRDSHIRE.. beating the bounds (2015)

**Sedayne — Blackthorn Feral Pre-mix (WEIRDSHIRE.. beating the bounds, 2015)**

**Jessica Squire — Staines Morris (Weirdshire 2 Burning The Bush, 2017)**
Dance/trad reference foregrounds folk lineage, but in a Weirdshire context it's tradition-at-an-angle. It highlights the genre's method: keep the folk signifiers, warp the feeling.

A direct link to a major folk-horror touchstone, functioning as a scene-signpost. It ties contemporary psych-folk to the "haunted landscape" lineage central to psychedelic dark folk.

**Nakatsu Takashi — Ame no hi ni wa (Nippon Acid Folk 1970-1980, 2024)**
Rain-day atmosphere is a classic pathway into dark folk mood, and psychedelia amplifies its sense of suspended time. A clean illustration of the genre's weathered melancholy.

**Jyoji Hirota — Kechuen (Nippon Acid Folk 1970-1980, 2024)**
A more ceremonial edge within a folk frame—darkness as rite-like focus rather than bombast. It demonstrates how psychedelic dark folk can gesture toward ritual without becoming Ritual Folk as a primary identity.
