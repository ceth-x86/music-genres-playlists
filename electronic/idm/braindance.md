# Braindance

## Rephlex Canon I (2001)

**The Gentle People — Journey (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
A rare braindance cut where pop-psychedelia and electronic toybox textures sit on tightly programmed beats. Its presence on Rephlex's defining braindance compilation shows how the genre prized fun, melody, and groove over solemn 'IDM' seriousness.

**Global Goon — Long Whiney (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Global Goon's loopy, slightly grimy machine funk captures braindance's bedroom-rave sensibility: danceable, but full of odd turns. It's emblematic of Rephlex's taste for off-kilter hooks carried by restless drums.

**Cylob — Rewind (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Cylob is one of braindance's purest electro-funk technicians, turning robotic bounce into something cheeky and human. 'Rewind' distills that Rephlex ethos—tight groove, strange humor, and maximalist synth personality.

**DMX Krew — The Glass Room (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
DMX Krew brings classic electro lineage into braindance without losing the genre's jittery detail. This short, punchy track highlights braindance's love of clean drum-machine punch paired with sly melodic motifs.

**D'Arcangelo — Diagram VII (80's mix) (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
D'Arcangelo's retro-futurist programming and neon synth grammar exemplify braindance's 'past imagined as future' aesthetic. The '80's mix' angle underlines how braindance recontextualizes vintage electronic vocab into hyper-modern rhythms.

**Bochum Welt — Fortune Green (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Bochum Welt's warm, lyrical synth writing shows braindance isn't just about complexity—it's about emotional melody inside kinetic beats. 'Fortune Green' is a textbook Rephlex track where sweetness and machine precision coexist.

**The Railway Raver — Keith's Trumpets (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
A braindance wink to rave history: brash motifs and chopped energy, but guided by leftfield arrangement choices. It captures the genre's habit of treating dance music as raw material for playful deconstruction.

**Baby Ford — Normal (Helston Flora remix by AFX) (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Baby Ford's material, retooled through AFX's lens, becomes a braindance lesson in how acid/techno DNA can be re-edited into labyrinthine groove. The remix credit also flags Rephlex's central role in naming and shaping the style.

**μ-Ziq — Swan Vesta (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
μ-Ziq's melodic intelligence and nimble drum programming are foundational to braindance's 'head + feet' paradox. This track balances singable synth lines with intricate rhythmic motion—cerebral, but insistently danceable.

**Vulva — Happy Birdie! Sad Birdie (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Vulva's cartoonish titles and squelchy synth attitude align with braindance's irreverence. The track's buoyant momentum and tonal play illustrate Rephlex's preference for groove with personality, not minimal cool.

**Vibert/Simmonds — (This can) Robotic (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
A collaboration that sits right on braindance's axis of acid squelch and breakbeat elasticity. It shows how the genre can be both rave-adjacent and compositionally quirky, with rhythmic drive never sacrificed.

**Chaos A.D. — Psultan (Squarepusher mix) (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
The Squarepusher mix pushes Chaos A.D. into braindance's drill-ish, hyper-detailed rhythmic universe. It's a snapshot of late-90s/early-00s cross-pollination where remix culture helped define braindance's high-energy edge.

**Bogdan Raczynski — Death to the Natives (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Raczynski's signature manic charm—naive melodic fragments over frantic percussion—became a key braindance flavor. This cut is important for showing how 'dance' in braindance could mean speed, chaos, and warped playfulness.

**Mike Dred & Peter Green — Kymera (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
A heavier, more industrial-tinged strand of braindance that still prioritizes movement and groove. Its long form and textural shifts exemplify how Rephlex artists stretched dance structures without abandoning pulse.

**Leila — Don't Fall Asleep (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Leila represents braindance's dialogue with bass pressure and broken-beat swagger, often with a darker urban tint. This track's presence on the compilation broadens the genre beyond pure synth athletics into mood-driven, still-danceable futurism.

**Ovuca — Afternoom Girl (The Braindance Coincidence, 2001)**
Ovuca's contribution is a reminder that braindance's history includes under-credited innovators, especially women working in a male-skewed scene. The track pairs off-kilter rhythm with melodic immediacy—exactly the genre's 'funny-but-precise' sweet spot.

## Rephlex Canon II (2003)

**Yee-King — Gammon (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Yee-King's bright, game-like melodicism captures the playful side of braindance without slipping into mere nostalgia. As an early-2000s Rephlex staple, it shows the genre's love of hooky synth writing riding on tight, restless drums.

**Astrobotnia — Walhalla (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Astrobotnia bring a Nordic electro-meets-IDM rigor that fits braindance's machine-funk core. 'Walhalla' is important for how it marries melodic clarity to robotic propulsion—dance music engineered for close listening.

**JP Buckle — Little Red Planet (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
JP Buckle's cut is a compact example of braindance's 'miniature world' songwriting: small motifs, hyper-focused edits, and strong forward motion. It demonstrates how the style can be concise yet densely programmed.

**Like a Tim — Spong. (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Like a Tim's track sits in braindance's oddball tradition, where quirky timbres and skewed phrasing still lock into a groove. It's a useful reference point for the genre's low-budget ingenuity and anti-gloss charm.

**Slipper — Alex (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
'Alex' channels braindance's preference for simple melodic cells animated by complex drum decisions. It's less about maximal spectacle and more about the subtle 'wrongness' that keeps the dance pulse alive.

**P.P. Roy — Dawn (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
P.P. Roy brings a gentler, sunrise-synth angle while maintaining braindance's rhythmic insistence. The track helps map the genre's spectrum from aggressive drilliness to buoyant, melodic machine pop.

**Pierre Bastien — Mentro (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Bastien's presence hints at braindance's fascination with self-playing machines and mechanical repetition. Even when the palette leans 'instrumental contraption,' the logic is still rhythmic and kinetic—brainy motion as dance.

**Ensemble — Two (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Minimal materials, but arranged with braindance's taste for uncanny groove and micro-variation. It's important as a reminder that braindance can be stripped-down without becoming microsound or ambient—pulse and pattern remain central.

**Robert Normandeau — Rumeurs (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
A leftfield inclusion that underscores Rephlex's broad, provocative definition of braindance. The track's montage sensibility aligns with the genre's obsession with editing and perception—dance understood as neurological stimulation.

**Amen Andrews — A Mix in the Assistant (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
Amen Andrews connects braindance to the amen-break lineage: jungle energy reframed with IDM-level detail. This track marks how Rephlex treated rave breakbeats as a playground for experimental, still-body-moving programming.

**AFX — Melo2 (Rephlexions! An Album of Braindance!, 2003)**
AFX (Richard D. James) represents braindance at its most virtuosic: tight melodic logic, crisp timbral choices, and a beat that never sits still. 'Melo2' became a reference for how braindance can be both immediately catchy and structurally eccentric.

## Revival & Regional (2018–2020)

**Brainwaltzera — rubico acid ([AF014] Bunker EP, 2018)**
Brainwaltzera is central to the 2010s braindance revival, updating Rephlex-era acid gymnastics with modern sound design. 'rubico acid' is a clean demonstration of 'smart dance'—squelch, swing, and meticulous drum micro-editing.

**Iconic Black Suit — Kyusho Braindance (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
A scene document: Swedish DIY braindance with a proudly rough-edged, acid-leaning bounce. The title is practically a manifesto—electro grit plus playful rhythm games.

**Roseland Jones — Present Me Missing Childhood Me (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
Braindance often couples childlike melodic fragments with adult-level programming, and this track embraces that tension. It's a strong example of contemporary producers using nostalgia as texture while keeping the beat sharply kinetic.

**Agartha Crispy — Chew Bakka (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
Agartha Crispy's cut illustrates braindance's appetite for odd timbres and humorous references, but anchored in a functional groove. It's the kind of track that makes complexity feel mischievous rather than academic.

**Pleb Acid Crew — Hear No Evil (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
As the name implies, this is braindance on the acid/electro tip: squelch and snap, but with IDMy arrangement quirks. It's valuable for showing the genre's continued link to dancefloor hardware aesthetics.

**Cubistic Lockian — It's Not You (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
A brisk, hook-driven track that captures braindance's 'breakbeat pop' potential—short motifs, lots of motion. It helps define the Swedish compilation's balance of humor, speed, and groove.

**Bengt The Spaniard — Jag Är Svensk lol (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
The title's self-parody matches braindance's long tradition of refusing po-faced seriousness. It's a neat reminder that wit and danceability can coexist with technical programming.

**Joanne Rodless — Sorted Innit (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
A compact blast of jaunty rhythm and off-center sound choices—braindance as quick sketch. It's important as part of the 'small scenes' ecology where braindance lives as community practice, not just canon.

**Funny Little Man — Wee Gnome Licker (Swedish Underground Braindance, 2018)**
Braindance thrives on the uncanny—cute, weird, and relentless at once—and this track leans into that. It's a great microcosm of the genre's cartoon exterior hiding serious rhythmic craft.

**Shadow Acid — Brainforest (Shadow Acid Files EP, 2020)**
Shadow Acid explicitly frames their work as acid braindance, and 'Brainforest' delivers that premise with sustained intensity. It's a modern, hardware-forward take that keeps the focus on forward motion rather than texture for its own sake.

**quasistate — Kyoto Protocol (VA-001, 2020)**

A community tribute that shows braindance as living culture: reworking Aphex-era templates into new rhythmic language. Toffo's remix keeps the original's minimal hook but injects contemporary swing and grit.

**Bichlid — 73-Yips (Movements 1-72) (Moving On, 2020)**

**Polyphony — On Remix (Mix 1) (Moving On, 2020)**
Long-form braindance that treats a small melodic cell as something to mutate for minutes at a time. The extended structure highlights the genre's fascination with permutation—dancefloor hypnosis via constant detail.

Windman's rework emphasizes braindance's balance of clear pulse and sideways timbral twists. It's a clean example of how remix culture helps keep braindance connected to its 90s roots while sounding current.

**Adam Harper — On Reload(ed) (Moving On, 2020)**
A 'reload' approach—taking a known IDM skeleton and reanimating it with sharper drums and brighter synth motion. This is braindance as scholarship-through-practice: respectful, but creatively disruptive.

## Curated Braindance (2024)

**n9oc — Hyphae (Braindance, 2024)**

**Poly Chain — Turbulent (Braindance, 2024)**
A kinetic, slightly abrasive cut that demonstrates braindance's continued love of pressure and speed. 'Turbulent' reads as dancefloor functional, but with leftfield contouring that keeps it firmly within IDM territory.

**Katatonic Silentio — Grain Of Consumption (Braindance, 2024)**
The track title hints at granular thinking, but the result stays groove-oriented rather than microsound abstraction. It shows how modern braindance can use tiny sonic particles to sharpen rhythm, not dissolve it.

**Edward — Blurry Trees And Peanuts (Braindance, 2024)**
A playful, slightly surreal closer that underlines Die Orakel's anti-nostalgia framing: it nods to a 'leftfield past' without copying it. The track's charm lies in how it keeps groove alive while letting details misbehave.

**Promising/Youngster — Wildcards (Sequences UDE002, 2024)**
