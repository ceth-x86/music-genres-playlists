# Progressive House

## Foundations & First Wave (1990–1994)

**Leftfield — Not Forgotten (Not Forgotten (12" single), 1990)**
A foundational early progressive blueprint: restrained groove, dubby pressure, and a slow-unfolding arrangement built for long blends. It helped define "progressive" as *structure and momentum* rather than a quick hook.

**React 2 Rhythm — Whatever You Dream (Whatever You Dream (12" single), 1992)**
A prime example of early progressive's "rolling hypnosis": minimal elements accrue meaning through accumulation. Its tension curve is DJ-friendly and forward-driving without tipping into techno or trance primacy.

**Gat Decor — Passion (Passion (12" single), 1992)**
One of the clearest early progressive house anthems: luminous chords and a steady 4/4 engine that feels *inevitably* rising. It codified the genre's euphoric lift while keeping the mixable long-form shape.

**The Sandals — A Profound Gas (A Profound Gas (12" single), 1992)**
A deep, spacious cut where groove is constant and interest comes from gradual textural movement. It exemplifies progressive house's early preference for atmosphere and narrative pacing over "tracky" repetition.

**Herbal Infusion — The Hunter (The Hunter (12" single), 1992)**
Early progressive house at its most cinematic: mood and space take priority, with tension created through small timbral shifts. The track's patience is the point—designed to *carry* a set rather than interrupt it.

**Andronicus — Make You Whole (Make You Whole (12" single), 1992)**
A classic incremental-build design: motifs mutate slowly, and the groove stays disciplined while the harmonic suggestion expands. It's "progressive" in the literal sense—built from measured evolution.

**Smells Like Heaven — Londres Strutt (Londres Strutt (12" single), 1993)**
A percussive, rolling foundation with swelling layers that create forward motion without overt "drops." It captures the early-90s progressive aesthetic of spaciousness, restraint, and long-range payoff.

**The Grid — Crystal Clear (Crystal Clear (12" single), 1993)**
Tight sequencing and bright synth architecture push early progressive toward a cleaner, more "engineered" sound. The arrangement remains gradual and DJ-minded, emphasizing ascent through layering rather than melody alone.

**X-Press 2 — London X-Press (London X-Press (12" single), 1993)**
A groove-first progressive tool: stripped, loop-driven, and built to be mixed for ages. Its importance is structural—showing how minimal changes can generate maximum dancefloor momentum.

**Spooky — Little Bullet (Gargantuan Mix) (Little Bullet (12" single), 1993)**
A defining "dark progressive" template: dubby bass weight, cavernous space, and slow-building drama. It demonstrates how progressive house can be intense without resorting to genre-crossing speed or riff overload.

**Bedrock feat. KYO — For What You Dream Of (For What You Dream Of (12" single), 1993)**

**Crescendo — Are You Out There (Are You Out There (12" single), 1995)**
