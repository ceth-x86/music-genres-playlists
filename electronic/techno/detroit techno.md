# Detroit Techno

## Foundations & Naming (1981–1990)

**Cybotron — Clear (Clear, 1983)**
Often treated as ground zero for Detroit techno: electro-tech drum programming, clipped synth hooks, and a futurist sheen that points past funk into machine music. Its hybrid of electro rigor and forward-looking minimalism became a template for early Motor City producers.

**Model 500 — No UFO's (No UFO's, 1985)**
A defining Juan Atkins statement: lean drum-machine propulsion paired with eerie, sci‑fi synth language that feels both mechanical and soulful. It helped codify Detroit techno's core aesthetic—futurism as dance-floor function—not just as a theme but as a sound.

**Rhythim Is Rhythim — Strings of Life (Strings of Life, 1987)**
