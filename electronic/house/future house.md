# Future House

## Coinage & First Wave (2013–2015)

**Tchami feat. Kaleem Taylor — Promesses (Promesses (Single), 2013)**
One of the earliest widely-cited templates for future house: deep-house groove pressure paired with a bright, metallic lead and a bouncy, sidechained drop. Its clean, minimal hook-writing helped define what made the style feel "future" rather than simply deep house.

**Martin Solveig & GTA — Intoxicated (Intoxicated (Single), 2014)**
A key early crossover where a future-house drop sensibility met radio-friendly songwriting and festival pacing. It helped normalize the genre's "big" drop language beyond the specialist house scene.

**Oliver Heldens — Gecko (Gecko (Single), 2014)**
A breakthrough track that made the genre's elastic bassline + shimmering-stab drop feel instantly accessible to big-room crowds. Its punchy sound design and no-nonsense arrangement became a reference point for countless later future house builds.

**Kideko — The Jam (The Jam (Single), 2015)**
A punchy club weapon that stresses groove, short vocal chops, and a springy bassline—hallmarks of future house's functional dancefloor design. It captures the genre's sweet spot between classic house call-and-response and modern "future" synth timbres.

**Vicetone — Catch Me (Catch Me (Single), 2015)**
Shows the more melodic, song-like side of future house while keeping the genre's signature buoyant bass and tight four-on-the-floor drive. A useful bridge between EDM-pop structures and a clean future-house drop aesthetic.

**Curbi — Discharge (Discharge (Single), 2015)**
An early example of the harder, more percussive edge future house could take without sliding into bass house. The aggressive bass articulation and swing-heavy groove made it a DJ-favorite for injecting energy into house sets.

**David Zowie — House Every Weekend (House Every Weekend (Single), 2015)**
A UK-flavored, groove-first take that helped show how future house could work as a bold, hooky club record. Its jackin' swing and stripped-down vocal phrasing point straight at the genre's deep-house/garage DNA.

**Pep & Rash — Rumors (Rumors (Single), 2015)**
A scene-defining vocal hook over a buoyant, syncopated groove—classic future house in its balance of simplicity and impact. The track's punchy low-end and clipped stabs became staple ingredients for the mid-2010s wave.

## Breakthrough & Standardization (2016)

**Aevion — The Call (The Call (Single), 2016)**
A melodic future-house cut that keeps the characteristic bounce while pushing a smoother, more songlike contour. It demonstrates the genre's knack for marrying emotional melody with highly functional dancefloor low-end.

**Bali Bandits — Tik Tok (Tik Tok (Single), 2016)**

**Don Diablo — Cutting Shapes (Cutting Shapes (Single), 2016)**
A signature statement of the Hexagon-era sound: funky rhythmic stabs, playful vocal cuts, and a drop built on bouncing mid-bass. It's a textbook example of future house's ability to feel both retro-funky and hyper-modern at once.

**Dastic — Crazy (Crazy (Single), 2016)**
Represents the Spinnin'-era pipeline that spread future house globally: a vocal hook, a crisp build, and a bassline engineered for peak-time response. Its straightforward structure makes it an ideal "textbook" DJ tool.

**Julian Jordan — Oldskool (Oldskool (Single), 2016)**
A modernized "ravey" future-house cut that keeps the genre's clean punch while nodding to classic dance motifs. It's a good example of how future house absorbed retro signifiers without abandoning its sleek mid-2010s sound palette.

**Lucas & Steve — Love On My Mind (Love On My Mind (Single), 2016)**

**Lucky Charmes — In My Arms (In My Arms (Single), 2016)**
Illustrates the pop-facing side of future house—uplifting topline energy paired with the style's signature bouncing bass and gleaming synth stabs. A reminder that the genre's impact often came from simple, memorable hooks.

**Mike Williams — Sweet & Sour (Sweet & Sour (Single), 2016)**
A clean, high-impact future-house single that leans into bright leads and a tightly compressed, spring-loaded drop. It also signals the genre's overlap with the "future bounce" direction without losing the core house pulse.

**TV Noise — Tell Me (Tell Me (Single), 2016)**
A playful, high-energy entry that foregrounds the genre's bouncy bass groove and chopped-vocal phrasing. It captures the mid-2010s moment when future house became a go-to sound for festival house sets.

## Golden Age & Label Scenes (2017–2018)

**Bougenvilla — No Sleep (No Sleep (Single), 2017)**

**Brooks & GRX — Boomerang (Boomerang (Single), 2017)**
A defining "future bounce" crossover moment—big, springy drops built on future-house bass behavior and bright, cartoonish leads. It influenced a wave of late-2010s mainstage house that kept future house's core movement but inflated its scale.

**Jonas Aden — Strangers Do (Strangers Do (Single), 2017)**

**Mesto — Chances (Chances (Single), 2017)**

**Justin Mylo — Burn Out (Burn Out (Single), 2017)**
A sleek STMPD-era take on future house: clean builds, tight sidechain, and a drop that prioritizes bounce over brute force. It highlights the genre's shift toward hyper-polished modern mixing without losing groove.

**Toby Green — Work It (Work It (Single), 2017)**
A club-tested future-house single where vocal chops and rhythmic stabs lock into a buoyant bass groove. It's representative of the genre's sweet spot: simple motif, strong swing, and immediate dancefloor payoff.

A melodic, neon-bright future-house track that keeps the bounce but emphasizes a singable lead. Its clean, upbeat character made it an accessible gateway into the genre for many listeners.

A bright, uplifting future-house cut that foregrounds melody while keeping the signature spring-loaded bass motion. It reflects the genre's capacity for optimistic, crowd-pleasing energy without drifting into progressive house.

**Mr. Belt & Wezol — Finally (Finally (Single), 2018)**
A modern club revision of classic house sensibilities, using crisp contemporary bass and drop design to refresh a familiar hook. It shows future house's role as a "translator" between old-school house references and modern EDM sonics.

**RetroVision — Get Down (Get Down (Single), 2018)**
A French-scene flavored future-house cut with a thick, rolling bounce and sharp, bright lead work. It captures the late-2010s pivot toward heavier low-end while keeping the groove and swing central.

**Hasse de Moor — Crave (Crave (Single), 2018)**
A groove-heavy track that stresses rhythmic bass movement and clean percussive space—future house at its most functional. It demonstrates the genre's ongoing commitment to swing, clarity, and drop-driven momentum.

**Jay Hardway — Need It (Need It (Single), 2018)**
A streamlined, hook-first future-house track that emphasizes a crisp build-to-drop payoff. It's representative of the late-2010s period when the genre's bounce became a default language for festival-friendly house.

**SWACQ — No Strings Attached (No Strings Attached (Single), 2018)**
A peak-time future-house/future-bounce hybrid that keeps the four-on-the-floor core but inflates the drop with mainstage-sized leads. It marks the point where future house techniques became a template for late-2010s festival house.
