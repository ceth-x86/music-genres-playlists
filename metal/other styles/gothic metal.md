# Gothic Metal

## Doom Gothic Foundations (1991–1995)

**Paradise Lost — Gothic (Gothic, 1991)**
The track that effectively gave the style its name in metal discourse: death/doom weight reshaped by gothic harmony, choir-like keyboards, and romantic gloom. It's a template for 'doom gothic metal' without losing metallic aggression.

**Cemetary — An Evil Shade of Grey (An Evil Shade of Grey, 1992)**
Early Swedish doom metal reframed as gothic confession: slower tempos, spectral harmonies, and lyrics steeped in personal darkness. It's a pivotal example of gothic mood becoming the dominant organizing principle.

**Type O Negative — Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All) (Bloody Kisses, 1993)**

**Anathema — Sleepless (Serenades, 1993)**
An early instance of death-doom turning toward gothic melancholy: funereal pacing, sorrowful leads, and a distinctly 'romantic ruin' atmosphere. It captures the moment extreme metal started privileging mood and longing over brutality.

**Katatonia — Tomb of Insomnia (Dance of December Souls, 1993)**
Notably gothic in spirit despite death/doom roots: funereal riffs and an oppressive, nocturnal atmosphere that prioritizes emotional gravity over extremity. It's an early proof that gothic metal's mood could be achieved through pure guitar tone and pacing.

A formative Swedish blend of doom pacing and gothic romanticism: mournful leads, autumnal harmonies, and a poetic melancholy that feels closer to gothic literature than to pure doom. It's a cornerstone for the genre's 'melancholic epic' strain.

**The 3rd and the Mortal — Why So Lonely? (Tears Laid in Earth, 1994)**
A quiet masterpiece of gothic doom's 'beauty' pole: airy female vocals and sorrowful guitars moving with chamber-like restraint. Its intimacy and restraint became a counter-model to both extreme-metal harshness and operatic bombast.

**Monumentum — A Thousand Breathing Crosses (In Absentia Christi, 1995)**
A rare 'art-gothic' angle inside metal: ritual pacing, post-punk shade, and decadent atmosphere, yet still riff-led and heavy. It proves gothic metal could be experimental and liturgical without sliding into avant-garde metal proper.

**My Dying Bride — The Cry of Mankind (The Angel and the Dark River, 1995)**
