## Foundations & blueprint era (1993–1997)

**LTJ Bukem — Music (Happy Raw) (Music (Happy Raw) / Enchanted (single), 1993)**

**Goldie — Inner City Life (Timeless, 1994)**
One of the genre's great expansions of emotional scale, pairing orchestral/choral ambition with relentlessly forward-moving break architecture. It's a landmark in positioning DnB as album-grade, not just rave-functional.

**4hero — Universal Love (Parallel Universe, 1994)**
A crucial bridge between rave break science and jazz-inflected harmonic thinking, pointing toward later musical DnB and beyond. Its sense of groove and chord movement helped widen what DnB could "feel like."

**Peshay — Vocal Tune (Piano Tune / Vocal Tune (single), 1994)**
A defining example of early atmospheric DnB: elegant pads, clean break edits, and deep bass that breathes. It became a touchstone for the genre's more introspective, "listening" dimension.

**Alex Reece — Pulp Fiction (Pulp Fiction / Chill Pill (single), 1995)**
Minimal, sub-led, and jazz-tinged, this is a blueprint for sparse DnB tension: swing is created through drum placement and negative space as much as through fills. Its stripped aesthetic strongly prefigures techstep and later minimal DnB logic.

**Dillinja — The Angels Fell (The Angels Fell (EP), 1995)**
Dillinja's low-end weight and physicality set a standard for bass engineering in mid-'90s DnB. It's a lesson in how to make space, drums, and sub interact as one machine.

**Source Direct — A Made Up Sound (A Made Up Sound / The Cult (single), 1995)**
A cornerstone of shadowy, intricate breakcraft that helped define "dark" sophistication without collapsing into chaos. It influenced techstep's colder palette and later neuro's sense of precision.

**Doc Scott — Far Away (Far Away (Fourteen Flavours of Funk) / It's Yours (single), 1995)**
Doc Scott's early mastery shows in the controlled roller momentum and sci-fi mood design. It's historically important for codifying the DJ-friendly "roller" as a core DnB form.

**Roni Size / Reprazent — Brown Paper Bag (New Forms, 1997)**
A flagship of DnB's jazz-meets-breakbeat mainstream moment, showing the genre could carry real melodic identity and instrumentation. Its visibility helped legitimize DnB beyond specialist spaces without diluting the drum language.

**Adam F — Circles (Colours, 1997)**
A melodic anthem that retains heavyweight drum-and-sub fundamentals while opening DnB to broader audiences. It's pivotal in the evolution of "uplifting" DnB songwriting that still stays inside the style.

## Liquid, atmospheric & musical DnB (1999–2009)
