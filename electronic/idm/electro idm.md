# Electro IDM

## Warp Artificial Intelligence era (1992–1994)

**The Dice Man — Polygon Window (Artificial Intelligence, 1992)**
A defining entry from the Artificial Intelligence era, when Warp popularized an electro-leaning, cerebral strain of electronic music that would be tagged as IDM. "Polygon Window" is textbook electro-IDM: functional syncopation, but with the arrangement and timbre doing the real narrative work.

**I.A.O. — The Clan (Artificial Intelligence, 1992)**
From the early Warp canon that helped separate IDM from club-centric techno by emphasizing texture, micro-structure and headphone focus. "The Clan" shows electro rhythm as the chassis, with IDM's restless edits and sonic precision layered on top.

**Up! — Spiritual High (Artificial Intelligence, 1992)**
Included here for its role in the Artificial Intelligence lineage, a key reference point for electro-IDM's balance of groove and abstraction. "Spiritual High" sits in the sweet spot: machine-funk pulse, plus the kind of structural curiosity that keeps it out of straight electro.

**Dr Alex Paterson — Loving You Live (Artificial Intelligence, 1992)**
Cut from Warp's Artificial Intelligence moment, a cornerstone in how early-'90s electro/techno experimentation was reframed as IDM for home listening. "Loving You Live" keeps an electro drum-machine logic upfront while the sound design and form lean decisively into IDM's detail-first mindset.

**Mark Franklin — Release To The System (Artificial Intelligence II, 1994)**
A defining entry from the Artificial Intelligence era, when Warp popularized an electro-leaning, cerebral strain of electronic music that would be tagged as IDM.

## Regional VA compilations & local scenes (2004)

**Ford Proco — Domestic Delight (Electro-Domestico Mextronica, 2004)**
Part of the 2004 VA Electro-Domestico Mextronica, useful as a map of how electro and IDM idioms were being recombined in diverse regional micro-scenes. "Domestic Delight" foregrounds machine rhythm but keeps the ear engaged through evolving detail—a core electro-IDM trait.

**Loopdrop — Mixmotronic (Electro-Domestico Mextronica, 2004)**
Appearing on the 2004 VA Electro-Domestico Mextronica, it captures a moment when electro-IDM was traveling through local scenes and small imprints rather than a single dominant label.

**Acidic Male — Faith (Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1, 2024)**
From Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1 (2024), a contemporary showcase where electro-IDM sits alongside acid and harder electronics without losing its detail-centric identity. "Faith" stays electro in rhythmic grammar, but its structure and timbral narrative are pure IDM.

**Swarm Intelligence — Generative (Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1, 2024)**
Appearing on Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1 (2024), it reflects electro-IDM's current form: functional machine rhythm, plus a listening-forward arrangement that rewards attention. "Generative" avoids straight genre adjacency by keeping the IDM 'composition' layer dominant.

**Somatic Responses — Subjective Completion (Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1, 2024)**
Selected from Natural Selection: Selected Works Vol. 1 (2024) to represent the modern underground where electro and IDM interlock as a shared design language. "Subjective Completion" holds the electro pulse steady while the micro-shifts and phrasing do the expressive work.
