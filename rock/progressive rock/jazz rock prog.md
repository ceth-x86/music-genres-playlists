|     1 | The Valentyne Suite                 | Colosseum                                 | Valentyne Suite                   |     1969 | A defining early blueprint: a side-long, multi-movement rock suite driven by jazz harmony and extended soloing. Its shifting meters and organ/sax interplay anticipate how prog structure and fusion language would lock together.                |
|     2 | Emergency                           | The Tony Williams Lifetime                | Emergency!                        |     1969 | A shock of volume and improvisation that put jazz virtuosity directly into a rock power-trio frame. The fractured forms and electric timbres became a key starting point for prog-leaning fusion bands.                                           |
|     3 | Elastic Rock                        | Nucleus                                   | Elastic Rock                      |     1970 | One of the earliest records to sound like “fusion” and “prog” at once: riff-based themes, open improvisation, and tight ensemble writing. The title track’s jagged groove and horn voicings set a template for jazz-rock that still feels modern. |
|     4 | Right Off                           | Miles Davis                               | A Tribute to Jack Johnson         |     1971 | A long-form, riff-centric jam that treats the studio take like a progressive rock side: build, sustain, mutate. Its relentless rock backbeat and electric guitar heroics helped define the aggressive end of jazz-rock prog.                      |
|     5 | Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon      | Chicago                                   | Chicago II                        |     1970 | A mainstream band reaching for prog-scale composition: a multi-part suite stitched from contrasting themes. The horn section functions like a jazz big-band inside a rock album format, a key early crossover gesture.                            |
|     6 | The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys   | Traffic                                   | The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys |     1971 | An early example of the jazz-prog “long track” archetype: hypnotic groove, modal soloing, and gradual structural expansion. Its blend of rock songcraft and jazz phrasing influenced many UK jazz-rock outfits.                                   |
|     7 | Ostinato (Suite for Angela)         | Herbie Hancock                            | Crossings                         |     1972 | A deep, cyclic ostinato piece that grows through layered polyrhythms and timbral change—very prog in its method of development. The electric textures and collective improvisation push fusion toward large-scale form.                           |
|     8 | Song of the Wind                    | Santana                                   | Caravanserai                      |     1972 | Santana’s most overtly prog-fusion moment: long-form composition, harmonic richness, and sustained instrumental narrative. It shows how a rock band could pivot into jazz-rock prog without losing guitar-led intensity.                          |
|     9 | Tillicum                            | Syrinx                                    | Long Lost Relatives               |     1971 | A cult classic of early fusion-prog: sharp unison heads, elastic time-feel, and wide-open solo sections. Its crunchy electric piano and guitar tones sit closer to prog rock than to straight-ahead jazz.                                         |
|    10 | Lambertland                         | Tasavallan Presidentti                    | Lambertland                       |     1972 | Scandinavian jazz-rock prog at full stride: complex ensemble themes, bluesy guitar edge, and episodic form. The track captures how European scenes fused prog ambition with jazz improvisation.                                                   |
|    11 | Slivadiv                            | Back Door                                 | Back Door                         |     1972 | A bass-led, organ-and-drums trio sound that feels like prog’s muscularity filtered through jazz language. Its tight riffs and sudden rhythmic turns became a touchstone for later instrumental prog-fusion.                                       |
|    12 | Clown                               | The Flock                                 | The Flock                         |     1969 | One of the rawest early mergers of rock band energy with violin-and-sax jazz vocabulary. The arrangement’s abrupt sectional shifts and solo features point directly toward jazz rock prog’s dramatic syntax.                                      |
|    13 | Variations on a Theme by Erik Satie | Blood, Sweat & Tears                      | Blood, Sweat & Tears              |     1968 | A baroque-to-jazz-rock suite that treats arrangement and modulation as the main event—proto-prog thinking inside horn-rock. It helped legitimize extended, quasi-classical form as part of the jazz-rock mainstream.                              |
|    14 | 33 222 1 222                        | Don Ellis Orchestra                       | Tears of Joy                      |     1971 | A famous odd-meter showcase where big-band writing meets electric-era propulsion. The piece demonstrates how rhythmic system-building—a prog hallmark—could be central to jazz-rock fusion.                                                       |
|    15 | Season of the Witch                 | Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger & The Trinity | Streetnoise                       |     1969 | A long, improvisation-heavy reinterpretation that stretches a song into a progressive jam-suite. The organ-led drive and jazz phrasing foreshadow the UK’s later jazz rock prog circuits.                                                         |
|    16 | Extrapolation                       | John McLaughlin                           | Extrapolation                     |     1969 | A key bridge between modern jazz harmony and the coming electric-fusion vocabulary. Even in a jazz setting, the angular themes and forward-motion comping suggest the prog-fusion language McLaughlin would soon crystallize.                     |
|    17 | Spaces                              | Larry Coryell                             | Spaces                            |     1970 | Coryell’s guitar brings rock attack into a jazz ensemble context, with extended forms and virtuosic interplay. The track shows early fusion leaning toward prog-like dramatic pacing rather than head-solo-head routine.                          |
|    18 | Da Da Man                           | Ginger Baker's Air Force                  | Ginger Baker's Air Force          |     1970 | A heavy, percussion-forward jazz-rock workout that feels closer to progressive live improvisation than to standard rock songwriting. It highlights how rhythm sections became laboratories for jazz-prog hybrid time-feels.                       |
|    19 | Meeting of the Spirits              | Mahavishnu Orchestra                      | The Inner Mounting Flame          |     1971 | A definitive manifesto: rapid unison lines, odd-meter surges, and seismic electric-guitar intensity. Few tracks announce the core aesthetics of jazz rock prog—virtuosity plus through-composed complexity—so immediately.                        |

|    20 | Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy             | Return to Forever     | Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy                        |     1973 | Return to Forever’s shift into full electric mode: long-form themes, virtuoso interplay, and rock weight. It became a cornerstone for prog-minded fusion bands balancing tight composition with explosive solo space.                       |
|    21 | Stratus                                | Billy Cobham          | Spectrum                                          |     1973 | A rhythmic engine room for the genre: monumental drum groove supporting harmonic movement and guitar/keyboard fireworks. Its structure—riff, development, extended solos—became a standard architecture for jazz rock prog instrumentals.   |
|    22 | Scorpio-Libra                          | Eddie Henderson       | Realization                                       |     1973 | Post-bop harmonic sophistication delivered with electric bite and open-ended form. The track captures fusion’s “composed head + progressive development” approach rather than simple funk vamping.                                          |
|    23 | Santiago                               | Dedalus               | Dedalus                                           |     1973 | Italian progressive fusion that treats the band like a chamber ensemble: sharp thematic writing, sudden metric pivots, and room for improvisation. It’s a textbook example of prog structure supporting jazz articulation.                  |
|    24 | Summer Games                           | Jukka Tolonen         | Summer Games                                      |     1973 | A guitar-forward fusion piece where lyrical themes and odd-meter turns coexist with rock attack. Tolonen’s writing shows how European prog guitar language could absorb jazz harmony without smoothing the edges.                           |
|    25 | Birdfingers                            | The Eleventh House    | Introducing the Eleventh House with Larry Coryell |     1974 | A high-velocity prog-fusion anthem built on complex unison figures and shifting sections. It exemplifies the “fusion as prog” idea: composition first, then improvisation as an extension of the form.                                      |
|    26 | Mind Movie                             | Secret Oyster         | Sea Son                                           |     1974 | Dense, cinematic Scandinavian jazz-rock with hard-edged riffs and fast harmonic movement. The track’s rapid transitions and disciplined ensemble hits are pure prog thinking in a fusion vocabulary.                                        |
|    27 | Spanish Sun                            | Isotope               | Illusion                                          |     1974 | A UK scene classic that fuses guitar-led rock dynamics with jazz phrasing and intricate rhythmic setups. Its balance of tight writing and improvisational breathing space became a model for later British jazz-prog.                       |
|    28 | Articolazioni                          | Arti & Mestieri       | Tilt (Immagini per un orecchio)                   |     1974 | Virtuosic Italian prog-fusion where percussion and melodic fragments interlock like machinery. The track’s angular themes and sudden accelerations are quintessential jazz rock prog dramatic rhetoric.                                     |
|    29 | Sekoilu Seestyy (The Madness Subsides) | Pekka Pohjola         | Harakka Bialoipokku                               |     1974 | A bass/composer-led piece that treats fusion like symphonic prog—motivic development, orchestral color, and episodic form. Pohjola’s writing broadened jazz rock prog beyond guitar-centric virtuosity.                                     |
|    30 | Cross-Collateral                       | Passport              | Cross-Collateral                                  |     1975 | Passport’s signature blend: driving rock pulse, sax-led jazz lines, and long, evolving arrangements. It’s influential for showing how a “band sound” (not just soloists) could carry prog-scale fusion narratives.                          |
|    31 | Mind Transplant                        | Alphonse Mouzon       | Mind Transplant                                   |     1975 | A fusion-rock powerhouse that merges compositional complexity with visceral groove. Mouzon’s drumming anchors a prog-like arc while guitars and keys roam through jazz harmony.                                                             |
|    32 | Some Skunk Funk                        | The Brecker Brothers  | The Brecker Brothers                              |     1975 | A canonical modern standard built from tight horn writing, tricky syncopations, and high-contrast sections. Its arrangement discipline and rhythmic sophistication align perfectly with jazz rock prog’s “precision + fire” ethos.          |
|    33 | Les porches de Notre-Dame              | Maneige               | Les Porches                                       |     1975 | Chambery, melodic prog-fusion where composition is as central as improvisation. The track’s shifting textures and formal clarity show the genre’s more “symphonic” side without leaving the jazz-rock language.                             |
|    34 | Timeless                               | John Abercrombie      | Timeless                                          |     1975 | An ECM-era take on prog-fusion: spacious production, rock-leaning electric pulse, and harmonically adventurous soloing. It demonstrates how jazz rock prog could be exploratory without relying on bombast.                                 |
|    35 | Suite Cassandra                        | David Sancious & Tone | Forest of Feelings                                |     1975 | A suite-like fusion statement built from contrasting sections and keyboard-driven development. Its formal ambition and rhythmic elasticity make it prog in method, even when the surface groove feels soulful.                              |
|    36 | Earth (The First Day)                  | Jan Hammer            | The First Seven Days                              |     1975 | A concept-album approach to fusion: synthesizer orchestrations and thematic development across “days” in a suite-like design. Hammer’s sound design and odd phrasing point directly toward later prog-fusion keyboard aesthetics.           |
|    37 | Nuclear Burn                           | Brand X               | Unorthodox Behaviour                              |     1976 | A benchmark for prog-fusion rhythm: fast odd-meter riffs that still groove, plus razor-sharp ensemble playing. It’s a textbook “jazz rock prog” track where complexity serves momentum rather than display.                                 |
|    38 | School Days                            | Stanley Clarke        | School Days                                       |     1976 | A bass-led anthem that made fusion feel like arena-ready progressive rock—riffy, virtuosic, and structurally clear. Clarke’s tone and technique became foundational for the genre’s low-end vocabulary.                                     |
|    39 | Continuum                              | Jaco Pastorius        | Jaco Pastorius                                    |     1976 | A lyrical, harmonically rich fusion piece that treats melody as a progressive through-line over shifting chords. Pastorius’s fretless phrasing expanded the expressive palette of jazz rock prog beyond guitar heroics.                     |
|    40 | Dark Side of the Moog                  | Colosseum II          | Strange New Flesh                                 |     1976 | Jazz-rock fusion pushed through a hard-prog guitar/keyboard attack, with sections that unfold like a mini-suite. It shows how prog’s heaviness could coexist with fusion precision.                                                         |
|    41 | Race with Devil on Spanish Highway     | Al Di Meola           | Elegant Gypsy                                     |     1977 | One of the definitive fusion-guitar “set pieces”: blistering alternate picking, shifting harmonies, and tight ensemble hits. Its cinematic pacing and technical intensity made it a rite of passage for prog-fusion players.                |
|    42 | Birdland                               | Weather Report        | Heavy Weather                                     |     1977 | A rare fusion track that became a broad cultural reference while keeping sophisticated harmony and arrangement. Its hooky theme and layered textures show how jazz rock prog can be both complex and immediately memorable.                 |

It’s crucial for widening the genre’s instrumental identity beyond the guitar/keyboard norm.                     |

It demonstrates how studio-perfectionist pop craft could still operate with prog-fusion ambition.          |
|    45 | The Colours of Chloë                   | Eberhard Weber        | The Colours of Chloë                              |     1974 | A composer-led fusion piece built like progressive chamber music: layered motifs, orchestral color, and long-range development. It’s essential for the genre’s more “composed” branch where prog architecture outweighs blues-rock riffing. |

|    79 | Thud                  | Bill Bruford's Earthworks     | Thud                          |     1988 | Earthworks recasts prog-fusion as drummer-led composition: interlocking patterns, odd-grouping grooves, and a band sound built for rhythmic clarity. The title track is essential for how it modernized jazz-prog without reverting to rock clichés. |
|    80 | Black Water           | The Zawinul Syndicate         | Black Water                   |     1989 | Zawinul expands fusion into layered world-polyrhythms and thick synthesizer orchestrations while keeping progressive, through-composed logic.

|    88 | No Sweat              | Gary Willis                   | No Sweat                      |     1996 | Willis brings the electric-bass modernism of 90s fusion into a composition-first framework. The track’s metric detail and melodic bass concept align with jazz rock prog’s emphasis on structural clarity and virtuosity.                            |
|    89 | Extraction            | Greg Howe                     | Extraction                    |     1997 | A late-90s fusion-rock showcase where progressive structure supports high-intensity guitar writing and rhythmic complexity. Howe’s phrasing and harmonic turns helped bridge shred-era technique into credible jazz rock prog composition.           |
|    90 | Vital Tech Tones      | Vital Tech Tones              | Vital Tech Tones              |     1998 | A supergroup-style fusion track that foregrounds composed themes and ensemble interplay over extended vamping. Its rock-level energy and tight arrangement make it a strong late-90s exemplar of jazz rock prog.                                     |

|    99 | FXMLDR                              | Thank You Scientist | Stranger Heads Prevail |     2016 | A horn-fronted prog-rock track whose harmony and improvisational language are unapologetically jazz.
