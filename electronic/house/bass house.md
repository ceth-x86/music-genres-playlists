## I. Blueprint Years: Bass House crystallizes (2014–2016)

**Jauz — Feel The Volume (Feel The Volume (Single), 2014)**
A defining early Bass House anthem: strict 4/4 drive with an outsized, "drop-forward" bass hook built for peak-time mixing. It's a key bridge between festival energy and house structure—Bass House as a mainstage-ready club tool.

**AC Slater — Bass Inside (Bass Inside (Single), 2014)**
A textbook Bass House template: house drums and phrasing, but the bassline is the lead voice and the drop is engineered for impact. It also represents the DJ-tool ethos that shaped a lot of the scene's club-first identity.

**Destructo — Party Up (Party Up (Single), 2014)**
A hip-hop-inflected party vocal frame over a hard, low-end-centric house chassis—very "bass as headline." It's important for showing how Bass House adopted rap cadence and chant hooks without losing house functionality.

**Malaa — Notorious (Notorious (Single), 2015)**
Dark, minimal, and bass-dominant—this is Bass House with g-house menace and nightclub pressure. Its impact is partly aesthetic: it helped cement the "masked," noir, and stripped-down aggressiveness in the genre's mid-2010s identity.

**Dr. Fresch — Take a Step Back (Take a Step Back (Single), 2015)**

**Autoerotique — Asphyxiation (Asphyxiation (Single), 2015)**

**Jack Beats — Work It (Work It (Single), 2016)**

**Chris Lorenzo — Foot & Mouth (Foot & Mouth (Single), 2016)**
