## Proto-Classic Foundations (1978–1980)

**Gina X Performance — Nice Mover (Nice Mover, 1978)**

**Kraftwerk — The Model (The Man-Machine, 1978)**
Minimal melody, clockwork groove, and a deadpan vocal—this is the template for synthpop's cool, mechanized charm. Its economy of means became a model for hundreds of early‑80s acts who put synth hooks where guitars used to sit.

**The Normal — Warm Leatherette (Single (later on T.V.O.D.), 1978)**

**Gary Numan — Cars (The Pleasure Principle, 1979)**
An early moment when a fully synthesizer‑driven track became arena‑scale pop, with a boldly simple riff doing the work of a rock hook. Its success legitimized the synth as a lead instrument for mainstream singles.

**Japan — Quiet Life (Quiet Life, 1979)**
