# Nu Metal

## Origins & First Wave (1994–1997)

**Korn — Blind (Korn, 1994)**
The opening riff and hip-hop-informed bounce set the nu metal template: downtuned guitars, stop–start grooves, and raw, confessional vocals. It's the moment the genre's mix of heaviness and street-level rhythm cohered into a recognizable new language.

**(hed) p.e. — Serpent Boy ((Hed) P.E., 1997)**
